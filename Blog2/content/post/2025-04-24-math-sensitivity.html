<p>C math library functions, such as <code>exp</code> or <code>sin</code>, are heavily used by R and
packages. The C standard doesn’t require these functions to be “precise”.
Instead, there is room for performance optimizations causing a reasonable
amount of inaccuracy. The results differ between platforms and may change
even on a single platform. This happened with mingw-w64 v12, the
SDK/runtime used by GCC and LLVM on Windows, which reduced accuracy of many
math functions (for performance and maintenance reasons).</p>
<p>Around 20 R CRAN packages ended up failing their tests as a result of this
and as these issues are hard to debug, Rtools45 ended up using an older
version of mingw-w64. Rtools will have to switch to current mingw-w64
eventually, but staying with v11 for now should allow time to resolve the
issues.</p>
<p>This text reports on the initial work on debugging these issues and presents
several types of problems encountered in packages. While this work is on
Windows, the problems in packages are general and potentially affect all
platforms: some packages are clearly too sensitive to even small
inaccuracies in math library functions.</p>

<h2>Debugging numerical issues</h2>
<p>This is not the first time I’ve ran into R packages failing their tests due
to unexpected numerical results. Debugging these issues is much harder than
good old correctness bugs, where one can relatively easily tell what is
correct and what is wrong, and accordingly narrow down the test to a case
that is small enough to find the cause and to decide which software
component is to blame and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>With the numerical issues, I often end up being told by the package authors
that the compiler (or math library, etc) is wrong and that I should report
it as a bug. But such a bug report would have to come with solid
argumentation that the behavior is wrong, ideally that it violates a
standard the code should follow.</p>
<p>Neither the C standard nor any other linked standard require “precise”
(correctly rounded) results of math functions. They don’t even require any
accuracy limits for them. Therefore, it is not realistic one would succeed
reporting inaccuracies to the provider of math functions, unless the
inaccuracies are very big (and this observation is based on experience,
discussions with mingw-w64 developers).</p>
<p>Reporting a small inaccuracy as a “non-reproducibility” issue is not
working, either: outside the R community, the priorities are set differently
and performance improvements within what is allowed by the standards are
welcome. From a testing (computer science) viewpoint, it may be actually
beneficial if systems change in ways that are allowed within the standards,
because it increases the chances true bugs are found in the software.</p>
<p>The common accuracy metric for the math library is ULP (“units in the last
place”, “units of least precision”), and one usually looks for the maximum
difference from the correctly rounded results across the whole domain of a
function. The general understanding is that several ULPs difference is
fine, but some functions (and perhaps in some domains) are more expensive to
get right than other, so the expectations may also depend on the function.
<a href="https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/papers/accuracy.pdf">[Gladman et al, 2025]</a> has more
details, references and measurements.</p>
<p>If a big inaccuracy was found in some math function, one could report it,
but indeed one needs to know which function, how inaccurate, and for which
inputs. So, the first goal of my debugging was to find out which math
functions cause failures of which packages, and how inaccurate these
functions really are for the inputs used.</p>
<p>Mingw-w64 provides a static library, <code>mingwex</code>, with internal
implementations of some math functions. The remaining ones are used from
UCRT, the Windows C runtime. Mingw-w64 v12 simply reduced the amount of
functions with internal implementations, about 90 functions were switched to
UCRT.</p>
<p>While testing a release candidate of Rtools45, which were to use mingw-w64
v12, 21 CRAN packages were identified as failing their tests because of
mingw-w64 v12, and it seemed likely that most of these because of numerical
differences (from the outputs of the failed tests, and also from the commit
logs of mingw-w64 v12). These 21 CRAN packages required 430 dependent
packages (from CRAN and Bioconductor) with a total library size of about 1G
when installed.</p>
<p>I’ve made some initial experiments manually, using debuggers, profilers,
reading the code of the failing tests. Also I’ve built R and packages with
<a href="https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a>, which provides more accurate
implementations of some of the functions. I’ve built R selectively with some
math functions from fdlibm, then also with some math functions from
<code>mingwex</code>. This way I was able to debug some of the packages, but it was
taking way too long.</p>
<p>To avoid frequent re-building of that 1G of code and simplify the debugging,
I’ve wrapped the math functions (ones switched in v12 to UCRT) by a dynamic
library and made all of R and packages use that library. I’ve then
experimented with different implementations of that dynamic library,
switching between math function implementations and reporting differences,
sometimes making custom changes to the dynamic library e.g. to enter a
debugger on some special input value.</p>
<p>So far I’ve been able to confirm that 14 of those 21 packages were failing
because of the new math functions in v12 and almost always because of their
reduced accuracy. On the other hand, looking into the causes revealed that
the inaccuracies involved were never above 1 ULP. In 13 cases, the problems
were in the packages (not in the library). One case is debatable (perhaps
in the compiler, more below).</p>
<p>The rest of the text covers the problems found in packages. I’m using
simplified code examples/pseudocode and intentionally not naming the
individual packages - that could have been be unfair given that likely many
other have the same problems, but just haven’t been discovered by this
exercise. Also, the original code would be too long for presentation.</p>

<div id="requiring-an-exact-numerical-result" class="section level2">
<h2>Requiring an exact numerical result</h2>
<p>One of the packages made an assumption that could be narrowed down to:</p>
<pre><code>x1 &lt;- -log(-expm1(-0.5))
x2 &lt;- -log1p(-exp(-x1))/0.5
x2 == 1</code></pre>
<p>This used to hold with mingw-w64 v11, but no longer with v12 (due to reduced
accuracy of <code>expm1</code>). The difference was in the very last bit:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sprintf(&quot;%a&quot;, x2)  # v11
[1] &quot;0x1p+0&quot;
&gt;  sprintf(&quot;%a&quot;, x2) # v12
[1] &quot;0x1.0000000000001p+0&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And the error in the involved <code>expm1</code> result is 1 ULP. The correct result can be
computed using mpfr library, from R using package Rmpfr.</p>
<p>The author of the package knows very well that checks for numerical results
should come with a reasonable tolerance limit, but has just forgotten in
this case, and the package used to be working for many years on three
different platforms. This change in mingw-w64 helped to find this bug.</p>
<p>While this input to <code>expm1</code> lead to 1 ULP error, by random search I found
input for which it was 3 ULP. <a href="https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/papers/accuracy.pdf">[Gladman et al,
2025]</a> reports
3.06. I learned this is still something regarded as acceptable by mingw-w64
developers. The paper reports inaccuracies also of other UCRT functions (my
understanding is that “MSVC” in the paper boils down to UCRT).</p>
<p>Another package used tolerance limits for comparisons of equality, but
forgot to use them for less-than/greater-than comparisons of computed
results, which has lead to a test failure (due to differences up to 1 ULP in
a math function).</p>
</div>
<div id="requiring-a-too-precise-result" class="section level2">
<h2>Requiring a too precise result</h2>
<p>Using a too low tolerance in tests was a common problem and not necessarily
surprising. A number of packages were failing tests due to unexpected
numerical results, caused by changes in <code>atan2</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>pow</code>, <code>sin</code>
and <code>sqrt</code>. But, all these changes compared to v11 were within 1 ULP.</p>
<p>Such problem could be caused either by an unrealistically narrow tolerance
limit (the tests should be updated), or by a numerically unsound
algorithm/implementation (the code is wrong and should be fixed).</p>
<p>At least two of the packages provided different tests (different
expectations and/or tolerances) for different platforms, apparently based on
what has been observed on those platforms (e.g. differentiating Windows,
macOS, Linux, once even looking at which Linux distribution). I think that
instead one should have a single set of expectations and tolerances, which
should be used on all platforms. If this makes the testing too weak (the
limits are too wide), perhaps the algorithms should be re-visited. Or, put
the other way, testing on different platforms is a kind of sensitivity
analysis that reveals a lower bound on realistic tolerances.</p>
<p>One package allowed very different results on different platforms - not just
differences in some low-order digits, but one test have accepted that the
same computation on one platform gave ~600 and on another ~1200. A sign of
that the algorithm/implementation is wrong.</p>
</div>
<div id="branching-based-on-numerical-result" class="section level2">
<h2>Branching based on numerical result</h2>
<p>One package included code with conditions based on comparisons of already
computed numerical result. While the package carefully rounded final
results before comparing them to expected values to allow for some
implementation-specific differences, the branches were simple/exact
comparisons. The code with this problem could look like</p>
<pre><code>  x &lt;- sin(y)
  if (x &gt; 0.543) z &lt;- 12.123
  else z &lt;- 157.51</code></pre>
<p>Due to small differences, again within 1 ULP from mingw-w64 v11, different
branches were takes with v12, providing results that did not satisfy the
tests.</p>
<p>In some cases, but not all, the differences were an <code>NA</code> (as a default
value) vs <code>NaN</code> as a computed value. One should be aware that <code>NA</code> could
become <code>NaN</code> in computations (more in <code>?is.nan</code>) and be prepared for that in
the tests. But, the problem here seems bigger as some differences involved
finite values: the algorithm will have to be adjusted.</p>
</div>
<div id="failures-due-to-constant-folding" class="section level2">
<h2>Failures due to constant folding</h2>
<p>This is perhaps the most interesting and surprising problem I’ve ran into,
and one where it seems questionable whether the problem is actually in the
package. And one that I’ve debugged fully, having to read the x86_64
disassembly of the involved code.</p>
<p>Imagine code like:</p>
<pre><code>double f(double x, double y)
{
  if (x == y)
    z = sqrt(sin(x) - sin(y));
  else
    z = 0;
  return z;
}</code></pre>
<p>The code was indeed more complicated and it took long to debug, but the core
problem is visible above. One would expect the result would be 0, but it was
<code>NaN</code>.</p>
<p>Function <code>sin()</code> in mingw-w64 v12 is now less precise than it was, but for
the argument observed, the difference was within 1 ULP. The function was
part of a program where the optimizer was able to figure out the value of
<code>y</code>, but not the value of <code>x</code>. At runtime, the values were exactly
identical, so the branch computing <code>sqrt()</code> was taken. The value of
<code>sin(x)</code> is computed at runtime using UCRT, but as the value of <code>y</code> was
known at compile time, the compiler also computed (constant-folded) the
value of <code>sin(y)</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler (GCC, which we use on Windows/x86_64 in Rtools) used a
correctly rounded result it computed using mpfr library. But, the UCRT
implementation is less precise and the result happened to be smaller, so the
argument of <code>sqrt()</code> became negative, and hence <code>NaN</code> was returned. In the
package, this has later lead to a runtime exception being thrown.</p>
<p>Constant-folding using correctly-rounded values makes it possible to
constant-fold also when cross-compiling, and hence also to generate the same
code when cross-compiling and when compiling natively. Also, even when
compiling natively, it could be that the version of the math library would
be different from the time when executing (and we would have the same
problem). Some also say that programmers probably wouldn’t object to
getting more precise values from the compiler than from the runtime library,
in principle, but, in this case it matters. One can disable constant
folding of the <code>sin</code> function (<code>-fno-builtin-sin</code>), but, how can one know in
advance. In principle, one could also disable constant folding of all
builtin functions. See the <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/fp-constant-folding-of-floating-point-operations/73138">LLVM
discussion</a>
for more on the difficulties with constant-folding of math functions.</p>
<p>It may not help in all cases, but sometimes a useful approach is to call a
function and then diagnose the result, rather than upfront checking the
arguments and then assuming the function will succeed. This is not
necessarily only the case with math functions, but it can avoid race
conditions with some other, say file system operations.</p>
</div>
<div id="depending-on-unspecified-behavior" class="section level2">
<h2>Depending on unspecified behavior</h2>
<p>It turned out not to be a numerical problem, but still involved a change in
a math function. Several packages ran into seemingly infinite computation
with v12. It turned out this was because of a single dependency, a package
that included a loop similar to this one:</p>
<pre><code>uint64_t rnd() {
  uint64_t res = 0;
  while (res &lt;= 2) {
    double u = uniform() * UINT64_MAX;
    res = lround(u);
  }
  return res;
}</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, one problem is that math function <code>lround()</code> gives a
long value, which is 32-bit on Windows. When the value doesn’t fit, the
result is unspecified. So, a double value between 0 and 1 is multiplied by
the maximum for <em>unsigned</em> 64-bit integer. When that doesn’t fit to a
<em>signed</em> 32-bit integer, which is common, <code>res</code> gets the unspecified value.
With v11, the unspecified value happened to be <code>LONG_MIN</code> (which came from
the Intel hardware, not even controlled by the internal <code>lround</code>
implementation), so <code>res</code> ended up something very large, yet not very
random, and the loop finished. With v12, the value returned from <code>lround</code>
happened to be 0 (probably controlled by UCRT), so the loop kept running.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is still work in progress. Some package failures with mingw-w64 v12
haven’t been analyzed, yet, and some of those may still be caused by
numerical differences. Some cases I’ve analyzed weren’t yet confirmed/dealt
with by the package authors.</p>
<p>The packages that were analyzed were reported to the authors, with patches
making the “easy” fixes or work-arounds, such as extending tolerance limits.
Some of the package authors have already fixed their packages, but some
would have to spend more time when it needs algorithmic improvements.</p>
<p>Some of the issues were reported to
<a href="https://github.com/mingw-w64/mingw-w64/issues">mingw-w64</a>, and I’ve used
advice from Martin Storsjo and other mingw-w64 developers in this work.</p>
<p>So far my interpretation is that this work revealed an important problem in
R packages: that (some of them) are overly sensitive to even very small
variations in inputs, such as (surprisingly) even the math library. And it
would be worth pursuing methods and tools to help detecting this more widely
- after all, it is true that many tolerances in tests are unreasonable, but
the question is how to choose reasonable tolerances. At least some fuzzing
of the inputs should be possible and perhaps could be implemented in later
stages of this work.</p>
<p>R packages in CRAN and Bioconductor are used as a test suite for changes in
R itself and in Rtools. The current practice is that such changes are
postponed or given up on if they break too many packages. When they only
break a little, the people making these changes (to R, Rtools) provide
advice or even patches to package authors to fix their packages.</p>
<p>This requires also debugging all problems found by package checks: without
debugging those, one cannot know if the problem is in some of the packages
(and which) or if in R, or in Rtools (hence say in the compiler, binutils,
some library). It is not an exception when a bug is woken up by an innocuous
change somewhere else, which can further extend the scope of the debugging.</p>
<p>This practice makes the R ecosystem much more stable than it would have been
otherwise. It helped to find real bugs in external software, including in
GCC, which have been reported and fixed upstream. On the other hand, given
this practice, problems in tests in packages, where they accidentally or
even intentionally capture unspecified behavior (including tests using too
narrow tolerances) complicate the maintenance of R itself. In this case, it
prevented an upgrade of a core Rtools component.</p>
