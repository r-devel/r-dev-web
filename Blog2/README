TLDR version:

   - go to working copy, directory where this file is located

     (read Fedora WARNING below re ppossible "permission denied" problems)
   - run
       docker run -it -p 4321:4321 -v `pwd`:/Blog kalibera/rblog

   - in the R prompt displayed, run
       blogdown::serve_site(host="0.0.0.0")

   - copy the URL shown in the output and open a web browser there (e.g. http://0.0.0.0:4321)
     keep the docker and the browser running

   - add or modify content in content/post

     when you save the file, the blog would be re-generated and the result
     will be shown in the browser; typically, you would add a single .Rmd
     file per post

   - when done, run this in the docker/R window
       blogdown::build_site(build_rmd=TRUE)
 
   - use svn to check the changes before committing; you may have to add
     some newly generated files or directories
     
  More details below.   

On blog location:

    This directory contains source and generated content which appears on
    https://blog.r-project.org/

    It includes RSS feed, accessible via https://blog.r-project.org/index.xml,
    which needs to validate according to
   
    https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi

    Absolute URLs need to be included in the feed, and the server part has
    to match the URL of the feed, so it is not possible to serve the
    (static) content from a different URL.

A docker image:

  There is now a docker image with pre-installed software to generate the
  (static) site from the blog posts.  It is to be used from a working copy
  of subversion

  https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/Blog2

  (so from the directory where this README file is)

  To download and use a pre-built version of the docker image, run:

    docker run -it -p 4321:4321 -v `pwd`:/Blog kalibera/rblog

  To build and use a local version, run:

    docker build -t rblog .
    docker run -it -p 4321:4321 -v `pwd`:/Blog rblog 

  Running the image gives an R prompt and the container has read-write
  access to the current directory, with all software necessary to
  (re)-generate blog posts.

  To display the blog site locally (e.g. when working on a blog post), run

    blogdown::serve_site(host="0.0.0.0")

  and open a web browser on the host system to point to http://localhost:4321
  The content should update automatically when any of the files is changed.

  To stop the server that is diplaying/generating the site locally:

    blogdown::stop_server()

  To regenerate all blog posts:

    blogdown::build_site(build_rmd=TRUE)

  If you prefer not to regenerate all posts, but only the new one(s), before
  committing updates:

    blogdown::check_content()
    blogdown::build_site()

  While the following text has instructions to install the needed software
  without docker, it includes important information also for bloggers using
  docker.

Fedora WARNING: vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
  I've ran into these problems on a Fedora host, which may be a coincidence,
  though, the problem is that the guest cannot access the mounted sources
  of the blog (which is strange, because, by default the guest runs programs
  as root in the guest). I got this output:

> blogdown::serve_site(host="0.0.0.0")
Error in site_root(config, .site_dir) : 
  Could not find config.toml / config.yaml / config/_default/config.toml / config/_default/config.yaml under
   /Blog
   /

  The guest cannot list "/Blog" directory. As a work-around, one might
  "docker cp" the content in before building the site, and copy it out after.
  
  So, after starting the container using something like
    docker run -it -p 4321:4321 kalibera/rblog /bin/bash

  find the container id using "docker container ps" and then do something like
    docker cp Blog2 c367562f081a:/Blog  (still on the host)

  and then, in the guest, run something like
    cd /Blog && /build/bin/R
  
  and then continue as described above (e.g. run blogdown::serve_site(host="0.0.0.0"))

  when the site is re-built, do something like this on the host

     tomas@fedora:~/svn/R-dev-web$ mkdir new
     tomas@fedora:~/svn/R-dev-web$ docker cp abff95411057:/Blog new/Blog2
     mkdir old
     mv Blog2 old
     mv new/Blog2 .

   etc (or check the differences before replacing)
  
Fedora WARNING: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a blog post and rebuild the site (all content is static):

1.  checkout svn from https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk

    (it helps to do this in a clean installation that does not have any more
     packages than needed for the blogs to build, because some blogs include
     R code which may be affected by extra packages, such as new conflicts
     between names exported from different packages)

2.  the blog is under "Blog2"

3.  get a recent version of R-devel to build the blog (some posts
    demonstrate new R-devel features, so one needs an R version with the
    features to build the .Rmd files)

4.  install blogdown package

    install.packages("blogdown") # or from github, see below

    blogdown uses "hugo" and provides functionality to install hugo (gives
    some R command to run the installation), but one can also install hugo
    manually on the local machine - on Ubuntu or Debian, it is "apt-get
    install hugo".

    hugo must not be too old (Ubuntu 18.04 has hugo 0.40 and it works fine,
    hugo 0.16 from Ubuntu 16.04 fails with "Error: unknown flag: --themesDir")

    On Ubuntu 20.04 (November 2, 2020, hugo version 0.68.3), the CRAN
    version of blogdown (0.21) did not recognize a running hugo server, so
    it killed it in serve_site().  A fixed version 0.21.33 could be found at
    https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown and worked.  At the time of writing,
    the CRAN version of blogdown didn't have this problem.

5.  install these packages (needed to build existing blog posts):
        dplyr, MASS, colorspace, tidyr, bench, ggplot2, tidyr, ggbeeswarm,
        kableExtra

      [ please update this list for any new dependencies, as well as the
        docker file ]

6.  run svn update

    it may help to delete unneeded local files, so that you only have what
    is in the svn and in the current version (because many new files will
    then be generated and one needs to add them, without accidentally adding
    files not intended for commit)

7.  go to directory Blog2, run "blogdown::build_site()" and check whether it
    finished without errors, rebuilding all blog posts; if not, go back to
    previous steps and try to fix the problem; note that from some recent
    version, blogdown stopped automatically rebuilding posts from Rmd files
    it has built already - use "blogdown::build_site(build_rmd=TRUE)" then
    to force the rebuilding

8.  when build_site() is happy, run "blogdown::serve_site()", this will open
    a web browser and display the current version of the blog from the SVN
    working copy, so even local uncommitted changes; it used to get
    automatically updated when you edit your blog post (Rmd file), but later
    it broke and wasn't automatically happening, later it get fixed again;
    in previous versions, the Rmd files were rebuilt to be shown (hard-coded
    URLs), currently that is no longer happening

9.  in another terminal window, go to "content/post" (to create a new post)

    start from copy of an existing post, e.g.  a copy of something like
    2018-03-23-dll-limit.Rmd, edit the meta data at the top of the Rmd file
    and edit the content; when one saves the file, hugo automatically
    rebuilds the blog _locally_ and the changes become visible in the local
    web browser (nothing is committed automatically)

10. when happy with the changes/new post, quit the R session running
    "serve_site()", re-start R, run "blogdown::build_site()"; that will take
    several seconds and rebuild all the blog posts (remember the need for
    option build_rmd=TRUE mentioned above); the blog posts should hence be
    written to be robust against rebuilding at a later time (do not include
    computations based on current time, on unfixed version of a package,
    etc).

11.  "svn add" newly created files and directories for the blog (in addition
    to the Rmd files, these will include a html version, rendered images,
    meta-data for categories and tags, etc)

12. svn commit

    an updated version of the blog will appear eventually (when the website
    gets auto-updated) at

    https://blog.r-project.org/index.html

General advice / experience:

- the generated output unfortunately depends a bit on the version of hugo
  and blogdown; sometimes the difference is unimportant, but it is still a
  bit of pain checking the diffs

- the committed version is usually generated with the latest Ubuntu LTS,
  hugo installed from Ubuntu and blogdown from CRAN and using recent
  R-devel; the plan is to use the docker image for it now that it is
  available

- the posts should contain only a small amount of code generation (not run
  benchmarks, not run tests, only use R for convenient rendering), so that
  the result is more portable and easier to maintain

- the posts should not depend on the current time of generation, because
  they are re-generated often (they should not print the current date/time,
  current R versions, etc); R should be used, if needed, only for rendering
  the content, not for demonstrating what R does/did/etc

- the posts should not depend on features/properties of R that are likely to
  change soon (e.g.  to demonstrate that something didn't work in an old
  version of R - such things have to be copied, not executed, because the
  blogs will eventually be re-generated with newer versions of R)

- the instructions here are based on experience with earlier versions and
  are intentionally defensive; it has been reported that one can now again
  get away now without rebuilding all of the blog posts, by running

  blogdown::stop_server() # if serve_site() was used before
  blogdown::check_content()
  blogdown::build_site()

- in either case, it is necessary to check any changes before committing,
  and all the blog posts should be "re-buildable", because time to time they
  will have to be rebuilt as the software for the site evolves
