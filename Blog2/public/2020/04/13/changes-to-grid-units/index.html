<p>One of the main downsides to the ‘grid’ graphics package is that
it is slow. And that makes some important packages that depend on ‘grid’,
like ‘ggplot2’,
slow. For example, the scatterplots shown below are roughly
equivalent, but one is drawn
using ‘graphics’ and the other using ‘ggplot2’.</p>
<p><img src="/Blog/public/post/grid-new-units-files/scatterplots.png" /></p>
<p>The ‘ggplot2’ version takes more than 4 times as long to draw.</p>
<p><em>(The benchmarks in this post were produced using the ‘bench’ package
within a Docker container
based on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-devel/"><code>rocker/r-devel</code></a>,
but with R-devel (r77995) built with
<code>--enable-memory-profiling</code> and a bunch of R packages installed;
the Docker images, <code>pmur002/grid-new-units-r-3.6.3</code> and
<code>pmur002/grid-new-units-r-devel</code>, are available from DockerHub.)</em></p>

<p>Thomas Lin Pedersen identified that, in
typical ‘ggplot2’ usage, a significant amount of time
was being spent creating and manipulating ‘grid’ “unit” objects
and this has lead to a change in
the internal implementation of “units” in the ‘grid’ graphics package
for R version 4.0.0.</p>
<p>On one hand, this is not news, because the public behaviour of ‘grid’ units
has not changed at all. However, there are two important
consequences of this change: one for users and one for developers.</p>
<p>For users, the reason for making the change was speed; with the new ‘grid’
units, certain operations go a lot faster (an order of magnitude or more
in many cases). For example, the following code that just
creates unit objects is up to ten
times faster with the new unit implementation.</p>
<pre><code>library(grid)

simpleUnit &lt;- function() {
    unit(1:100, c(&#39;mm&#39;))
}
stdUnit &lt;- function() {
    unit(1:100, c(&#39;mm&#39;, &#39;inches&#39;))
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="/Blog/public/post/grid-new-units-files/units-timing.png" /></p>
<p>Although manipulating units is only a fraction of what packages like ‘ggplot2’
do, the impact of the unit speed up
is sufficient to be noticeable in the production of ‘ggplot2’ plots.
The plots below include examples of both simple and complex ‘ggplot2’ plots.</p>
<p><img src="/Blog/public/post/grid-new-units-files/ggplot2.png" /></p>
<p>The following timings show that the new unit implementation in ‘grid’
can translate to a 10%-20% speed-up in ‘ggplot2’ plots.</p>
<p><img src="/Blog/public/post/grid-new-units-files/ggplot2-timing.png" /></p>
<p>For developers, the impact of the changes to ‘grid’ units should be
neutral, but they
can be disastrous if a
package has been peeking and poking at the internal implementation
of ‘grid’ units.</p>
<p>We believe that we have identified most of these cases and that
most of those have now been fixed. In case some problems have not
yet come to light, the following known problems and solutions may
be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it is possible for a package to contain a saved R object that contains
old-style ‘grid’ units. There are protections in the new ‘grid’
implementation to upgrade such objects to new-style units or, at worst,
generate an error. Recreating the saved R object should hopefully
resolve any issues.</p></li>
<li><p>several packages were extracting attributes from “unit” objects, e.g.,
the <code>"mm"</code> from <code>unit(1, "mm")</code>; there is a new <code>grid::unitType()</code>
function that may help packages to avoid accessing ‘grid’ unit internals in the
future.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There was also a small lie earlier: the public behaviour of ‘grid’ units
has actually
changed a little because the printing of some units is now different.
For example, the following code and output shows that arithmetic
on units produces a different printed result.</p>
<pre><code>Loading required package: grDevices
&gt; getRversion()
[1] ‘3.6.3’
&gt; library(grid)
&gt; unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) - unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)
[1] 1npc-1cm
&gt; </code></pre>
<pre><code>Loading required package: grDevices
&gt; getRversion()
[1] ‘4.0.0’
&gt; library(grid)
&gt; unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;) - unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;)
[1] sum(1npc, -1cm)
&gt; </code></pre>
<p>The original design and implementation of new units was contributed
by Thomas Lin Pedersen. Paul Murrell contributed minor fixes
and features and lead the testing, diagnosis, and remedying
of problems in packages. Paul Murrell’s contribution was partially
supported by a donation from R Studio to The University of Auckland
Foundation.
Both authors would like to acknowledge the patience and support
of the CRAN team and the cooperation of the authors of the
numerous package that were affected by these changes.</p>
