<p>Since its inception, R has, at least by default, converted (character)
strings to factors when creating data frames directly with <code>data.frame()</code>
or as the result of using <code>read.table()</code> variants to read in tabular data.
Quite likely, this will soon change.</p>
<p>In R 0.62 (released 1998), the original internal data frame code was
replaced by the interpreted Statlib code contributed by John Chambers,
to the effect that <code>data.frame()</code> would always convert strings to
factors (unless protected by <code>I()</code>), whereas <code>read.table()</code> kept having
an <code>as.is</code> argument (defaulting to <code>FALSE</code>).</p>
<p>In R 2.4.0 (released 2006), <code>data.frame()</code> and <code>read.table()</code> gained a
<code>stringsAsFactors</code> argument, defaulting to <code>default.stringsAsFactors()</code>,
which in turn would use the <code>stringsAsFactors</code> <em>option</em> if set, and
otherwise give <code>TRUE</code> by default. At that time, this seemed an acceptable
way forward, but in hindsight, it was not a very good idea: as code
shared with others could no longer make safe assumptions about the
stringsAsFactors default being used, it should (at least in theory)
always have used <code>data.frame()</code> and <code>read.table()</code> defensively with
explicitly specified <code>stringsAsFactors</code> arguments. (In addition to this
need for “safe” usage being quite a nuisance, there also was no
straightforward mechanism to programmatically ensure it: one can set
options in user or site profiles, but these are not always read when
checking.)</p>
<p>There are at least two more good reasons for changing the current
mechanism.</p>
<p>Automatic string to factor conversion introduces non-reproducibility.
When creating a factor from a character vector, if the levels are not
given explicitly the sorted unique values are used for the levels, and
of course the result of sorting is locale-dependent. Hence, the results
of subsequent statistical analyses can differ with automatic
string-to-factor conversion in place.</p>
<p>One might hypothesize that this was not an issue in the good old days
when everything was ASCII-only. However, this is not the case. On my
Debian system, <code>locale -a</code> finds 872 locales (not all of which are
different, of course). Using these to sort the all-ASCII vector</p>
<pre><code>     c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>finds the following frequencies of sorting patterns:</p>
<pre><code>     01aAbB 01AaBb 01ABab aAbB01 
        793     57     14      8 </code></pre>
<p>The second group contains e.g. Danish, Norwegian and Turkish; the
third C/POSIX, Japanese and Korean; and the last Czech and Slovak.</p>
<p>This clearly shows that reproducible data analysis should really avoid
all automatic string to factor conversions. (After careful
deliberation, the R Core Team has come to the conclusion that making
these conversions locale-independent by employing a specific locale
for the sorting is not feasible in general.)</p>
<p>Finally, looking at modern alternatives to data frames shows that
data.table uses stringsAsFactors = FALSE by default, and tibble never
converts.</p>
<p>Hence, in the R Core meetings in Toulouse in 2019, it was decided to
move towards using <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code> by default, ideally
starting with the 4.0.0 release.</p>
<p>Eventually, the stringsAsFactors option will thus disappear. For the
time being, it was actually made possible to consistently set the option
(and hence the stringsAsFactors default) via an internal environment
variable <code>_R_OPTIONS_STRINGS_AS_FACTORS_</code>: the base and recommended
packages were already modified last year to work correctly irrespective
of the default setting, and some of the regular CRAN checks will soon
switch to using <code>_R_OPTIONS_STRINGS_AS_FACTORS_=false</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things are not as simple as changing the default value
for the <code>stringsAsFactors</code> arguments to <code>data.frame()</code> and
<code>read.table()</code> (which of course, even though in theory it should not
matter, will have considerable impact). When adding the
<code>stringsAsFactors</code> argument to <code>read.table()</code> in R 2.4.0, <code>data()</code> was
changed to use</p>
<pre><code>  read.table(..., header = TRUE, as.is = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>when reading in data files in <code>.tab</code> or <code>.csv</code> formats. Thus, when
reading in such data files, strings are <em>always</em> converted to factors.
As this conversion was always performed, irrespective of the
stringsAsFactors settings, it will remain, but get modified to always
use the C sort order in the conversions, to the effect that loading such
data sets will become locale-independent.</p>
<p>In the interest of enhancing reproducibility, the R Core Team is also
considering adding a mechanism for optionally noting automatic string to
factor conversions (i.e., calling <code>factor()</code> on a character vector without
giving the levels, or calling <code>as.factor()</code> on a character vector).</p>
