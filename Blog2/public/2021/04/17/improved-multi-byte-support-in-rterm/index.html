<p>Support for multi-byte characters and hence non-European languages in RTerm,
the console-based front-end to R on Windows, has been improved. It is now
possible to edit text including multi-byte and multi-width characters
supported by the current locale, so that e.g. Japanese R users can edit a
Japanese text. To appear in R 4.1.</p>
<p>This is a by-product of fixing RTerm to support all Unicode characters when
running in UTF-8, which is already possible in experimental UCRT builds of
R-devel.</p>
<p>Users who are interested in using RTerm with non-European languages are
invited to test the new version and
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html">report</a> bugs.</p>
<div id="testing" class="section level2">
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>To experiment with the new RTerm in the official CRAN MSVCRT build in
R-devel, install R from
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html">here</a> or the usual
places following the 4.1 release process.</p>
<p>To experiment with the UCRT build, see the
<a href="https://blog.r-project.org/2021/03/12/windows/utf-8-toolchain-and-cran-package-checks/index.html">blog post</a>
about those builds and install R from
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The UCRT build requires UCRT, which has to be installed manually on Windows
7 and Windows 8, but is already shipped with Windows 10. Only on recent
Windows 10 (November 2019 release or newer), it will use UTF-8 as the native
encoding. On older Windows 10 it will use the
system locale like the MSVCRT build.</p>
<p>When UTF-8 is used as native encoding, one needs to run <code>chcp 65001</code> before
running R (more below). Use <code>l10n_info()</code> to see if UTF-8 is the native
encoding.</p>
<p>To test the MSVCRT build on a machine running in a European language locale,
one needs to switch the locale for testing multi-byte characters. This is a
system-wide setting and only should be changed with care. One can switch
the display language back say to English from elevated PowerShell command
line (when it becomes too difficult from the user interface):</p>
<pre><code>Set-WinSystemLocale en-US
Set-WinUserLanguageList en-US -Force</code></pre>
<p>The new changes have been tested in Windows 10, 8 and 7.</p>
</div>
<div id="console-and-terminals" class="section level2">
<h2>Console and terminals</h2>
<p>RTerm uses the (legacy) Windows console API and is best tested in <code>cmd.exe</code>.
It is expected to work best in <code>cmd.exe</code> and PowerShell.</p>
<p>When using UTF-8 as the native encoding, one needs to change the terminal
code page to UTF-8 manually in these terminals (<code>chcp 65001</code>) before running
RTerm. Also one needs to choose a font with the proper glyphs (e.g. 
<code>NSimFun</code> for Asian languages).</p>
<p>Unicode characters can be entered via <code>Alt+ +hexcode</code>. E.g. to enter
<code>\u30f3</code> (Katakana Letter N), press and hold Alt, while holding it press <code>+</code>
on the numpad, type <code>30f3</code>, then release the Alt. One can also simply copy/paste
characters to test from another application.</p>
<p>RTerm works less well in custom/redirection terminals, such as mintty, the
default terminal in Msys2. This is closely related to limitations of the
legacy Windows console design, as described in detail in this <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-backgrounder/">blog post
series</a>.</p>
<p>The legacy design does not really allow to implement custom terminals. This
is only possible via a hack when the custom terminal uses a hidden console
buffer and observes (detects) changes happening on it. On output, these
terminals have to translate control characters into console API function
calls. Mintty does not do the latter directly, but one can use winpty tool
for that. In order to work in mintty, RTerm automatically invokes winpty
when available. Similar problems by Windows design exist in other custom
terminal applications.</p>
<p>One observed problem of RTerm in mintty, which existed already before the
new multi-byte support, happens typically when typing fast: mintty looses
control over RTerm as if it crashed and exited, but RTerm keeps spinning in
the background. Sometimes, when typing fast or pasting a lot of text via
OpenSSH, some characters are lost resulting in garbled line. These problems
have not been observed in <code>cmd.exe</code>.</p>
<p>Recently, Windows introduced
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/">conPTY</a>
interface, which finally makes it possible to use ANSI escape sequences for
control characters in streams of bytes, such as on Unix. Once winpty/mintty
and other custom terminals are rewritten to support this new API, these
problems with RTerm will hopefully go away, and possibly even without RTerm
supporting directly conPTY, because Windows does the translation. RTerm
seems to be working fine in Windows Terminal, which uses conPTY.</p>
<p>Even with the legacy Windows console API, RTerm needs to take care of
surprising/unspecified behavior (how multi-byte characters are received, how
surrogate pairs are received, how some characters not supported by the
current keyboard are received, etc). Some of these things tend to change.
Fixing these issues is typically quite simple, but reporting bugs is
essential for that to happen.</p>
</div>
<div id="getline-changes" class="section level2">
<h2>Getline changes</h2>
<p>RTerm uses a customized version of the getline library for line editing,
originally written by Chris Thewalt. It has minimalistic requirements on
the terminal and has been hence ported to many systems over the years. From
control characters, it only uses <code>\b</code> to advance one position left, <code>\r</code> to
return to the left-most position and <code>\n</code> to scroll one line down.</p>
<p>Getline is designed around a buffer holding the line (bytes of the text) and
the current cursor position in the buffer. Edit commands, such as
insertion, deletion or a cursor movement, modify the buffer and then trigger
a “fixup” operation, which updates the terminal to reflect what is in the
buffer and move the cursor to the desired position. As an optimization,
fixup knows the minimum byte index that has changed and sometimes the
maximum as well.</p>
<p>Getline implements scrolling within a single line. Too long text may be off
the right edge (dollar sign displayed on the right end of the screen) and/or
off the left edge. Hence, in getline, the edited line always takes only one
line on the screen, unlike e.g. in readline.</p>
<p>The fixup moves the cursor left using <code>\b</code> to the first position that needs
to be changed, then prints the characters representing the change, then
prints any padding (spaces) to remove remains of the previous line, and then
moves the cursor to its final location using <code>\b</code> (left) or emitting more
characters (right), which are however already on the screen.</p>
<p>The library was implemented at times when a single printable byte was a
single character and took a single screen position. So now it has been
rewritten to reflect that characters may be multi-byte, may have different
widths, and that an edit unit may be formed by multiple characters. This
required significant changes to the fixup operation. To maintain mappings
between screen positions, bytes and edit units, getline now has three
additional maps (arrays) updated during fixup.</p>
<p>One consequence for scrolling is that the first byte on screen (bigger than
zero when off-left) needs to be aligned to edit units, so its offset depends
on what is exactly the text in the buffer. Similarly, the width of the text
when off-right is not constant, but depends on the width of the complete
edit units in the text that can fit to the screen. Edit operations need to
change complete edit units and advance cursor to positions aligned to edit
units.</p>
</div>
<div id="character-sequences" class="section level2">
<h2>Character sequences</h2>
<p>Normally, an edit unit is formed by a single character, and this will always
be the case in the CRAN builds of R 4.1. Multiple characters per unit are
only relevant when using UTF-8 as native encoding, so in the experimental
UCRT builds of R-devel.</p>
<p>An example Unicode sequence is <code>\u63\u30c</code>, letter <code>c</code> followed by a mark
telling the terminal to put a caron over the letter. The same letter can be
represented by <code>\u10d</code>, but not all sequences have a compact form.</p>
<p>When running in UTF-8 as native locale, RTerm on input joins any zero-width
character with the previous edit unit. This allows entering a number of
Unicode sequences including <code>\u63\u30c</code>, but not all, some sequences
may be joining multiple positive-width characters, e.g. 
<code>\udc1\udca\u200d\udbb</code> or <code>\U1f43b\u200d\u2744</code>.</p>
<p>Given the fixup operation has been implemented with sequences in mind, it
should not be hard to add support for these more complicated sequences, but
it currently does not seem possible to test/debug even the simpler sequences
because no currently available terminal application on Windows seems to
support them properly. R itself does not treat sequences in a special way,
either, so some functions would provide surprising results.</p>
</div>
<div id="supplementary-characters" class="section level2">
<h2>Supplementary characters</h2>
<p>RTerm now supports supplementary Unicode characters, which are those
represented by surrogate pairs in UTF-16. In practice, this is only
relevant to the experimental UCRT builds of R-devel, where one can actually
have such characters supported by the locale (UTF-8).</p>
<p>Thanks to the support for supplementary characters, one can enter/paste and
edit text say using Emoji characters when the terminal supports them. This
was tested and worked in the Windows Terminal with the appropriate font. It
also worked in a terminal running on Linux over ssh.</p>
<p>RTerm may have been one of the harder places to fix in R to support
supplementary characters, but not the only one. At the time of this
writing, even though one can use RTerm to edit a line including Emoji
characters, they cannot be printed using <code>print()</code>. The remaining issues
should be resolved before R uses UTF-8 as the native encoding on Windows.</p>
<p>Unlike character sequences, this limitation is specific to the Windows
design of multi-byte support, where some POSIX encoding-conversion functions
do not support supplementary characters. There is no problem on Linux nor
macOS as they support UTF-8 natively.</p>
