      <description>Microsoft provides a free Windows 10 virtual machine for testing. Package maintainers working on Linux and MacOS can use it to test their packages on Windows. See instructions on how to set up the machine automatically for checking R packages.
The set up provides SSH access with bash, so that users can perform most of the tasks from their preferred terminal emulator. Command line tools needed to build R and many R packages from source are pre-installed.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is useful to test R on unusual platforms, even when the expected number of users is not large at the moment. It is better to be ready when a new platform arrives or becomes more widely used, it may be easier to find some bugs on one platform than other, and such testing may reveal code unintentionally too platform specific.
Recently I wanted to test R on 64-bit ARM (Aarch64) and on Power.</description>
