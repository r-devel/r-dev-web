      <description>C math library functions, such as exp or sin, are not guaranteed to be “precise”. The results might be slightly different on different platforms. A recent change in mingw-w64 v12, which is a core dependency of compilers we use on Windows (both GCC and LLVM), resulted in failures in about 20 CRAN packages. Rtools45 uses mingw-w64 v11, the same version as Rtools44, to allow time for resolving the issues. The change in mingw-w64 v12 switched about 90 math functions from internal implementations to UCRT, the Windows C runtime provided by Microsoft and shipped with the OS.</description>

      <description>C math library functions, such as exp or sin, are heavily used by R and packages. The C standard doesn’t require these functions to be “precise”. Instead, there is room for performance optimizations causing a reasonable amount of inaccuracy. The results differ between platforms and may change even on a single platform. This happened with mingw-w64 v12, the SDK/runtime used by GCC and LLVM on Windows, which reduced accuracy of many math functions (for performance and maintenance reasons).</description>
