      <description>When using R interactively from the command line, one can interrupt the current computionation using Ctrl+C key combination and enter a new command. This works both on Unix terminal and on Windows console in Rterm. Such computation may be implemented in R or C and may be executing an external command while waiting for the result e.g. via system(,wait=TRUE).
However, in R 4.3 and earlier, Ctrl+C interrupts also background tasks, e.</description>

      <description>When testing development versions of Rtools for Windows, I’ve ran into strange failures of several CRAN packages where R could not find, read from or write to some files. The files should have been in temporary directories which get automatically deleted, so it took some effort to find out that actually they existed and were accessible. That didn’t make any sense at first, but eventually I got to this output:</description>

      <title>Issues While Switching R to UTF-8 and UCRT on Windows</title>

      <description>From version 4.2.0 released in April 2022, R on Windows uses UTF-8 as the native encoding via UCRT as the new C Windows runtime. The transition for R and its packages has been a non-trivial effort which took several years. This post gives a summary some technical obstacles found on the way, focusing on aspects that may be interesting to other projects.

      <title>Sporadic Rterm Crashes with Completion</title>

      <description>This post is a story of a bug in Rterm, the console R front-end on Windows, which has been bugging me for several years, but only two weeks ago it showed up unwarily so that I could trace it down and fix.
The terminal sometimes crashed during completion, so after I pressed the tab key, but it was very rare, there seemed to be no way to reproduce the problem, and it was only happening with the mintty terminal (from Msys2, running bash), never with cmd.</description>

      <title>Upcoming Changes in R 4.2.1 on Windows</title>

      <description>R 4.2.1 is scheduled to be released next week with a number of Windows-specific fixes. All Windows R users currently using R 4.2.0 should upgrade to R 4.2.1. This text has more details on some of the fixes.
R 4.2.0 on Windows came with a significant improvement. It uses UTF-8 as the native encoding and for that it switched to the Universal C Runtime (UCRT). This in turn required creating a new R toolchain for Windows and re-building R, R packages and all (statically linked) dependencies with it (Rtools42, more details on the transition).</description>

      <description>R 4.2 for Windows will support UTF-8 as native encoding, which will be a major improvement in encoding support, allowing Windows R users to work with international text and data.
This new feature will require at least Windows 10 (version 1903) on desktop systems, Windows Server 2022 on long-term support server systems or Windows Server 1903 from the semi-annual channel. Older Windows systems will be able to run R, but with the same limitations in the encoding support as in R 4.</description>

      <title>Improved Multi-byte Support in RTerm</title>

      <description>Support for multi-byte characters and hence non-European languages in RTerm, the console-based front-end to R on Windows, has been improved. It is now possible to edit text including multi-byte and multi-width characters supported by the current locale, so that e.g. Japanese R users can edit a Japanese text. To appear in R 4.1.
This is a by-product of fixing RTerm to support all Unicode characters when running in UTF-8, which is already possible in experimental UCRT builds of R-devel.</description>

      <description>Microsoft provides a free Windows 10 virtual machine for testing. Package maintainers working on Linux and MacOS can use it to test their packages on Windows. See instructions on how to set up the machine automatically for checking R packages.
The set up provides SSH access with bash, so that users can perform most of the tasks from their preferred terminal emulator. Command line tools needed to build R and many R packages from source are pre-installed.</description>

      <title>Windows/UTF-8 Toolchain and CRAN Package Checks</title>

      <description>A new, experimental, build of R for Windows is available, its main aim being to support the UTF-8 encoding and especially non-European languages. Check results for CRAN packages are now available on their CRAN results pages. Please help by reviewing these for your package(s) and if a Windows user by trying the new build, particularly if you use a language written in a non-Latin script.
The new build can be downloaded from [2] and instructions are at [1].</description>

      <title>Windows/UTF-8 Build of R and CRAN Packages</title>

      <description>R-devel-win.exe is an experimental installer of R, set up to download experimental binary builds of CRAN packages. It sets UTF-8 as the current default encoding on Windows (Windows 10 November 2019 release or newer). 92% of CRAN packages are supported. Intended as a demonstration of this option to support Unicode characters in R on Windows, not for production use.
To play with this version of R, start cmd.exe, run chcp 65001 (to set UTF-8 code page), go to Properties/Font/Font and select NSimFun (a font with glyphs needed for this example), go to C:\Program Files\R\R-devel\bin (default installation directory of the demo), run R.</description>

      <description>R internally allows strings to be represented in the current native encoding, in UTF-8 and in Latin 1. When interacting with the operating system or external libraries, all these representations have to be converted to native encoding. On Linux and macOS today this is not a problem, because the native encoding is UTF-8, so all Unicode characters are supported. On Windows, the native encoding cannot be UTF-8 nor any other that could represent all Unicode characters.</description>
