      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. An important feature of R that encourages its use around the world is the support for localization. This enables R’s messages, warnings and errors, as well as menu labels in the Windows and Mac OS GUIs, to be shown in the user’s local language.&#xA;Localization relies on translations that are contributed and maintained by volunteer translation teams.</description>

      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is another post on how you might help (Reviewing Bug Reports was the first).&#xA;This post is about helping with testing of pre-release versions of R.&#xA;Maintaining and improving R unavoidably comes with introducing regressions, that is breaking things which worked before. This also happens when external software changes its behavior (OS, compilers, libraries).</description>

      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is the first in several posts on how you might help. This post is about helping to review and resolve bugs reported on the R bug tracker.&#xA;Urgent bug reports, in particular ones with simple reproducible examples, are generally resolved and closed quickly. But those that are not can sometimes languish for a long time.</description>
