<p>For conversion of strings from a given character encoding to another, R uses
<code>iconv</code>, a function defined by POSIX. It is available on Linux and macOS
with the operating system and for Windows, R ships with a slightly
customized version of <code>win_iconv</code>, which implements the same functionality
on top of Windows API.</p>
<p>The differences between iconv implementations, partially allowed by a rather
permissive definition of the interface in POSIX, pose a challenge for
maintaining R and cause differences between platforms observed by users.</p>
<p>A recent significant challenge has been new iconv implementation that came
with macOS 14.0. It not only changed the behavior with characters not
representable in the target encoding, but also caused crashes and incorrect
conversions. This post focuses on work-arounds in R, some of which were
already in R 4.4, but have been extended and improved in R-devel, the
development version of R to become R 4.5.0. The work-arounds were part of a
bigger effort dealing with libiconv changes on macOS, otherwise mostly by
Brian Ripley.</p>
<p>This text includes technical details. The higher-level message to users and
package authors is that converting characters to an encoding where they are
not representable is platform-dependent and the outcomes can change over
time; while R documents what it does with such characters, it won’t happen
when the system silently transliterates the characters without telling R.
It is best to avoid such conversions, so e.g. to only use characters in
plot labels that are representable in the given encoding (more in <code>?pdf</code>).
It is good to use UTF-8 whenever possible. A message specific to R package
authors and developers on macOS: when R is built from source, by default the
system libiconv will be used, which may behave strangely and change its
behavior on any system update. This is currently not the case with R CRAN
builds.</p>
<div id="non-representable-characters" class="section level1">
<h1>Non-representable characters</h1>
<p>What should ideally happen when converting a string where some characters
cannot be represented in the target encoding? It probably depends on what
we need the string for. If it is say a file name of a file to be saved, we
would probably want to throw an error. But, already in the error message
for such an error, we would want to see exactly what was the
non-representable character (e.g. Unicode <code>U+0161</code> or bytes <code>&lt;C5&gt;&lt;A1&gt;</code> for
Unicode Small Letter S with Caron). If it is a file name of a file to be
selected say from a user dialog, some might prefer to see a replacement
character (e.g. a question mark, possibly in a diamond). If it is a plot
label, we might prefer, for some characters, to get a similarly looking
replacement character (e.g. <code>s</code> so simply drop the caron). In other words,
the application, in this case R on an R package, should have full control.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this cannot be efficiently implemented using iconv, relying
only on the POSIX specification. According to POSIX, non-representable
characters are subject to implementation-defined conversion, so the
implementation is free to say replace all such characters by <code>*</code> (or any
other character, and the behavior may depend on the encoding), but POSIX
doesn’t specify a way how non-representable characters could be reported to
the user.</p>
<p>While it probably could be claimed as a violation of POSIX, some
implementations report valid but non-representable characters the same way
as invalid characters (bytes). The conversion stops at the first byte of
the non-representable character and <code>EILSEQ</code> is returned. R handles this
behavior and implements its own handling of non-representable characters.</p>
<p>On Linux with glibc, this allows R to have full control, because glibc’s
iconv implementation reports <em>all</em> non-representable characters this way. It
also used to be the case on macOS (before 14.0), where the system iconv was
GNU libiconv.</p>
<p>On Windows, transliteration (called “best fit”) historically has been used
and is the default behavior in non-standard Windows API for character
conversion. Some non-representable characters are replaced by similarly
looking ones, while other are reported as error. This is what Windows users
are used to and expect, but it means that R doesn’t know about
transliterated characters in the output and handles them as if they were
unique representations.</p>
<p>In plots transliteration may be fine and expected, in handling of file names
highly undesirable. R’s customized version of win_iconv has been set to
report non-representable characters only when converting to ASCII (so
disabled transliteration) as a compromise between what is common in Windows
and R’s ability to customize the outcome based on what the string is needed
for. Windows API, however, allows to disable transliteration completely.</p>
<p>Before R 4.2, the problem with transliteration on Windows has been bigger
than in later R versions, because the native encoding wasn’t a Unicode one
(it is UTF-8 from R 4.2 on recent Windows systems). Before R 4.2, one could
run into transliteration e.g. when working with R symbols (names), where
say the letter alpha would silently become letter a. The bugs in R (or
non-bugs, but behavior that surprised users) due to non-representable
characters on Windows really almost disappeared with R 4.2.</p>
<p>On Unix, UTF-8 has been normally the native encoding much earlier, so one
would have thought that we won’t run again into many problems with
non-representable characters, or even other problems in character
conversion.</p>
<p>This turned out not completely true. There is musl, a C library
implementation used by some less common Linux distributions, which comes
with an iconv implementation which replaces non-representable characters all
by an asterisk (so no transliteration, no reporting of non-representable
characters). This doesn’t affect typical platforms used these days.</p>
<p>But then, there was macOS 14.0.</p>
</div>
<div id="iconv-on-macos" class="section level1">
<h1>Iconv on macOS</h1>
<p>The source code for the system libiconv on macOS can be found
<a href="https://opensource.apple.com/releases/">here</a>. In macOS before 14.0, it
used to be GNU libiconv. In macOS 13.5, it was still version 1.11 of GNU
libiconv (named libiconv-64 on the website above). It was a rather old
version, but still provided almost the same behavior in R as the
implementation of iconv in glibc on Linux and worked fine. GNU libiconv
1.12 has been released in 2007, 16 years before macOS 13.5, and has changed
the license for the tool from GPL version 2 to version 3, yet the library
itself remained at LGPL.</p>
<p>Instead of updating its GNU libiconv, macOS 14.0 came with iconv based on an
implementation from Citrus/FreeBSD (named libiconv-80.1.1 on the website
above), which has been modified to identify itself as GNU libiconv 1.11.
All the versions in macOS up to 15.0 (latest I’ve checked) report libiconv
version this way. See how the author of GNU libiconv
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2024-02/msg00123.html">described</a>
this decision. The source code of libiconv provided with macOS claims
compatibility with GNU libiconv 1.11, but as it turned out, there were
changes in the handling of non-representable characters as well as newly
introduced bugs.</p>
<p>Note that when R is built from source on macOS, by default it dynamically
links to the system libiconv, which can be changed by any OS update. So,
existing R installations broke by a system update bringing the new libiconv,
while <code>extSoftVersion()</code> would still report the same iconv (<code>"GNU libiconv 1.11"</code> or <code>"Apple or GNU libiconv 1.11"</code>, depending on the version of R, not
the library).</p>
<p>The version reporting has been extended in R-devel to show also the name of
the shared library, e.g. <code>"Apple or GNU libiconv 1.11 /usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib"</code>.</p>
<p>CRAN builds of R provided by Simon Urbanek currently use a static build of
libiconv-64, so the last version of iconv on macOS which matched GNU
libiconv 1.11. Hence, the CRAN builds of R aren’t affected by the problems
of the new libiconv. In the current R-devel CRAN build, <code>extSoftVersion()</code>
would report iconv to be <code>"Apple or GNU libiconv 1.11 /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.5-arm64/Resources/lib/libR.dylib"</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>extSoftVersion()</code> one can hence see whether a system libiconv is in
use, and then one can check the version of macOS e.g. via <code>sessionInfo()</code>,
and then consult the <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/releases/">Apple website</a>
whether it already has source code for the corresponding libiconv.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-representable-characters-on-macos" class="section level1">
<h1>Non-representable characters on macOS</h1>
<p>In the new libiconv on macOS, many characters are transliterated or
replaced. This is something that the POSIX specification allows, but it
changes the previous behavior on the system and hence also in R, and R
package tests depending on the previous outcome would show differences.</p>
<p>Even though R on macOS (as well as on other current systems) uses UTF-8 as
the native encoding, conversion to 8-bit encodings is done when plotting
(see <code>?pdf</code> for more). Normally, the 8-bit encoding is Latin-1. R detects
and reports when a character cannot be represented, but, it cannot do that
when it doesn’t know - e.g. when iconv silently transliterates or replaces
some of the characters.</p>
<p>To reduce the platform differences and alert users to the problem, thanks to
Brian Ripley R now transliterates some of the characters commonly used in
plots, with a warning, and the warnings and replacement of
non-transliteraded characters have also been improved. One can then see
when testing e.g. on Linux or CRAN macOS builds that the transliteration
would happen or that a character is not representable, and ideally avoid
using that character to avoid platform differences and possible future
problems. Also, if one keeps the non-representable characters, the outputs
will still have fewer differences between platforms thanks to the
transliteration done in R. See the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html">NEWS
file</a> for more
details.</p>
<p>I’ve written a simple <a href="https://github.com/kalibera/iconvtest">program</a> to
detect what iconv does with non-representable characters during conversion,
whether they are replaced, reported via <code>EILSEQ</code>, or discarded. The program
also allows to experiment with non-standard features of iconv documented on
macOS that should allow to disable transliteration or/and enable reporting
of non-representable characters via <code>EILSEQ</code>.</p>
<p>When converting to ASCII, the differences between libiconv-64 and
libiconv-86 (macOS 14.1) are small and probably wouldn’t cause much trouble.
The normally used characters are not transliterated, but are still reported
via <code>EILSEQ</code>. It is possible to enable transliteration (or disable
<code>EILSEQ</code>) - we don’t want to change the defaults, but changing it works.</p>
<p>But, when converting to say CP1252, libiconv-86 introduces a lot of
transliteration/replacing of non-representable characters. It is not
possible to disable the transliteration nor to enable <code>EILSEQ</code>. Actually,
transliteration appears disabled already, but is still happening. A cursory
look at the source suggests that there are different places where
transliteration can be triggered, but some may be harder to handle than
other.</p>
<p>The observed behavior seems contradicts the documentation on macOS, which
states that transliteration is always enabled and cannot be turned off, that
doing so would fail with an error. If the behavior is ever changed to allow
disabling transliteration, R could do that to regain control over the
non-representable characters, to make sure that e.g. in plots they are
reported to users.</p>
<p>In principle, there is always a rather inefficient way to detect
transliteration/replacement of characters via double conversion (convert
back and compare), and there is some experimental code in R that allows
that, but it may be easier to detect these problems with Linux or current
CRAN builds of R, and avoid using non-representable characters. That
approach would also avoid problems say with musl.</p>
</div>
<div id="bugs-on-macos" class="section level1">
<h1>Bugs on macOS</h1>
<p>The following describes other problems found in the new libiconv on macOS,
which now have work-arounds in R-devel, so should be invisible to users (and
packages).</p>
<div id="crash-after-invalid-byte" class="section level2">
<h2>Crash after invalid byte</h2>
<p>At the time of macOS 14.1 (so libiconv-86), before the release of R 4.4.0,
I’ve been debugging sudden crashes of R on macOS narrowed down by Brian
Ripley to be due to libiconv. I found that libiconv, and hence R, crashes
some time after encountering an invalid byte on input. Invalid input is
sometimes provided intentionally in tests, sometimes by accident, but
certainly shouldn’t crash R.</p>
<p>I found that after correctly reporting the byte as invalid, iconv will then
erroneously report the following bytes as invalid as well, and eventually
crash in subsequent calls. I found that when we re-set the iconv conversion
state after the first invalid byte is encountered, the problem disappears.
It sounded as a good thing to do, anyway. R isn’t tested with stateful
encodings, but in principle, one should not unnecessarily assume a stateless
encoding, so one should re-set before emitting escapes for invalid bytes
(e.g. <code>&lt;FC&gt;</code>). I’ve thus modified R code itself to do that, and also I’ve
extended <code>Riconv()</code> to do that automatically on macOS for stateless
encodings, so that even packages are covered. The idea was that for a
stateless encoding, the state re-set should have no impact (in a correct
implementation), so it is safe to do and will cause no harm even once this
is fixed in libiconv.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this caused a regression in the CRAN builds of R 4.4.0 which
still used libiconv-64. That version of libiconv has another bug (described
next), which interfered with this work-around.</p>
</div>
<div id="bom-forgotten-after-reset" class="section level2">
<h2>BOM forgotten after reset</h2>
<p>To correctly decode UTF-16 or UTF-32 input, the decoder needs to know the
byte-order (little or big endian). One can specify the byte order as part
of the encoding name to iconv, e.g. “UTF-16LE”, or one can specify the
encoding without it (“UTF-16”) and then include a byte-order mark at the
beginning of input. The byte-order mark (BOM) is Unicode character U+FEFF
(zero-width no-break space), and from how its bytes are laid out the decoder
infers the byte-order. If the BOM is not present, the decoder uses the
default order.</p>
<p>My reading of the POSIX standard is that the byte-order learned from BOM is
<em>not</em> part of the encoding state, because UTF-16 and UTF-32 are stateless
encodings. Instead, the byte-order learned from BOM should be immutable and
stay that way until the conversion stream is closed. This is also explicitly
stated by Ulrich Drepper in a response to a <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=165368">bug
report</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some iconv implementations forget the byte-order learned from
BOM on reset, as if it was part of the shift/conversion state, as if
UTF-16/-32 were a stateful encoding. This problem is not present in iconv
in Linux/glibc, but it is present both in GNU libiconv 1.11 as well as in
later versions of libiconv on macOS. Also, it doesn’t help that the default
byte-order with libiconv on macOS is big-endian (while UTF-16 is mostly used
on Windows where it is encoded as little-endian).</p>
<p>Conversion state reset is a relatively rare operation, after all it should
ever only be needed with stateful encodings; but, not so rare with the
work-around for the crash after an invalid byte. This problem of the
work-around was found after R 4.4.0 has been out and when the present
libiconv on macOS already has been fixed (libiconv-92 no longer had that
problem). So, as a minimal hot-fix, R 4.4.2 comes without the work-around
for the crash after an invalid byte, and this is intended to remain the
behavior with R 4.4.x.</p>
<p>In R-devel, there is now a work-around also for the case that iconv forgets
the byte-order after reset. <code>Riconv</code> would listen to the input and after
seeing the BOM, it would continue decoding with byte-order specified to
iconv via the encoding name, e.g. “UTF-16LE”.</p>
<p>In addition to that, all work-arounds for iconv in R-devel are now
conditional on runtime tests. So, specifically with a system libiconv no
longer getting confused after an invalid byte, R would not be issuing state
resets anymore.</p>
<p>The problem of forgetting BOM after reset is still present at least in
libiconv-107 (macOS 15.0).</p>
</div>
<div id="bom-forgotten-on-incomplete-character" class="section level2">
<h2>BOM forgotten on incomplete character</h2>
<p>The new libiconv on macOS (from libiconv-86 to libiconv-107 at least) also
has forgets the byte-order learned from BOM when it is given an incomplete
character to decode. This is a quite serious bug, because an incomplete
character on input is a common situation during iterative conversion, when
one reads in some part of input, gives it to iconv to convert, then reads
some more, etc. This specific pattern is heavily used in R and other
applications, and there is probably no other way using iconv. It is also on
of the examples in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/iconv-Examples.html">Glibc
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>R-devel checks at runtime whether this problem is present, and if it is the
case, it uses the same work-around as for BOM forgotten after re-set, by
falling back to conversion using the byte-order specified in the encoding
name.</p>
