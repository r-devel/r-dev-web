      <description>At WWDC 2020 earlier this year, Apple announced a transition from Intel to ARM-based processors in their laptops. This blog is about the prospects of when R will work on that platform, based on experimentation on a developer machine running A12Z, one of the “Apple silicon” processors.
The new platform will include Rosetta 2, a dynamic translation framework which runs binaries built for 64-bit Intel Macs using just-in-time, dynamic translation of binary code.</description>
