      <title>Updating Graphics Devices for R 4.2.0</title>

      <description>A number of new graphics features have been added to the R graphics engine in the development version of R (to become version 4.2.0):
groups, compositing operators, affine transformations, stroking and filling paths, and luminance masks. This has consequences for R packages that provide graphics devices, like the ‘ragg’ package.
For users of R packages that provide graphics devices, those packages will need to be reinstalled when updating to R 4.</description>

      <description>Support for gradient fills, pattern fills, clipping paths and masks was added to the R graphics engine in R version 4.1.0.
The development version of R (likely to become R version 4.2.0) contains support for several more graphical tools: groups, compositing operators, and affine transformations, plus some tweaks to paths and masks.
An R-level interface for these new features has been added to the ‘grid’ graphics package.
library(grid) The following code demonstrates drawing a group with the new grid.</description>

An R-level interface for these new features has been added to the ‘grid’ graphics package.
library(grid) For example, the following code fills a circle with a linear gradient.
grid.circle(gp=gpar(col=NA, fill=linearGradient())) The next code fills a rectangle with a radial gradient.</description>

      <title>Improvements to Clipping in the R Graphics Engine</title>

      <description>UPDATE (2020-11-18): canClip = NA_LOGICAL has been replaced by deviceClip = TRUE
The R graphics engine performs some clipping of output regardless of whether the graphics device it is sending output to can perform clipping itself. For example, output that is sent to the postscript() device, which can do its own clipping, is still clipped by the graphics engine to the edges of the device.
This is useful for devices that cannot clip, e.</description>
