      <title>Parser Speedups</title>

      <description>It wasn’t my primary goal to improve parser performance nor to measure it. I’ve been working on optimizations to reduce the runtime overhead of including source reference into packages (this is not done by default due to space and execution time overheads). I’ve added an option to exclude parse data from source references and enabled it by default for packages, as parse data account for most of the runtime overhead of source references while they are rarely needed.</description>

      <title>Unprotecting by Value</title>

      <description>In short, UNPROTECT_PTR is dangerous and should not be used. This text describes why and describes how to replace it, including mset-based functions that have been introduced as a substitute for situations when unprotection by value is really needed. This could be of interest to anyone who writes native code to interface with the R heap, and definitely to all who use UNPROTECT_PTR in their code.
Background R provides several functions to protect pointers to R objects held by local C variables (typed SEXP) from the garbage collector.</description>
