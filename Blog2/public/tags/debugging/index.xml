      <description>This post is a story of a bug in Rterm, the console R front-end on Windows, which has been bugging me for several years, but only two weeks ago it showed up unwarily so that I could trace it down and fix.
The terminal sometimes crashed during completion, so after I pressed the tab key, but it was very rare, there seemed to be no way to reproduce the problem, and it was only happening with the mintty terminal (from Msys2, running bash), never with cmd.</description>

      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is the first in several posts on how you might help. This post is about helping to review and resolve bugs reported on the R bug tracker.
Urgent bug reports, in particular ones with simple reproducible examples, are generally resolved and closed quickly. But those that are not can sometimes languish for a long time.</description>
