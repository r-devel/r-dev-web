      <description>Support for multi-byte characters and hence non-European languages in RTerm, the console-based front-end to R on Windows, has been improved. It is now possible to edit text including multi-byte and multi-width characters supported by the current locale, so that e.g.Â Japanese R users can edit a Japanese text. To appear in R 4.1.
This is a by-product of fixing RTerm to support all Unicode characters when running in UTF-8, which is already possible in experimental UCRT builds of R-devel.</description>
