      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is another post on how you might help (Reviewing Bug Reports was the first).&#xA;This post is about helping with testing of pre-release versions of R.&#xA;Maintaining and improving R unavoidably comes with introducing regressions, that is breaking things which worked before. This also happens when external software changes its behavior (OS, compilers, libraries).</description>

      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is the first in several posts on how you might help. This post is about helping to review and resolve bugs reported on the R bug tracker.&#xA;Urgent bug reports, in particular ones with simple reproducible examples, are generally resolved and closed quickly. But those that are not can sometimes languish for a long time.</description>
