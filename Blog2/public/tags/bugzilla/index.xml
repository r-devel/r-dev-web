      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is another post on how you might help (Reviewing Bug Reports was the first).
This post is about helping with testing of pre-release versions of R.
Maintaining and improving R unavoidably comes with introducing regressions, that is breaking things which worked before. This also happens when external software changes its behavior (OS, compilers, libraries).</description>

      <description>Just a quick update and note of thanks to all who have responded to our blog post on 2019-10-09 and helped with reviewing and resolving bug reports. Thanks to your help the pace at which bugs have been resolved has increased nicely since the date of that post:
Our special thanks to Michael Chirico, Henrik Bengtsson, Suharto Anggono, Hugo Gabriel Eyherabide and Elin Waring, who have contributed most in this period.</description>

      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is the first in several posts on how you might help. This post is about helping to review and resolve bugs reported on the R bug tracker.
Urgent bug reports, in particular ones with simple reproducible examples, are generally resolved and closed quickly. But those that are not can sometimes languish for a long time.</description>
