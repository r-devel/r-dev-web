      <description>R 4.2 for Windows will support UTF-8 as native encoding, which will be a major improvement in encoding support, allowing Windows R users to work with international text and data.
This new feature will require at least Windows 10 (version 1903) on desktop systems, Windows Server 2022 on long-term support server systems or Windows Server 1903 from the semi-annual channel. Older Windows systems will be able to run R, but with the same limitations in the encoding support as in R 4.</description>

      <description>A new, experimental, build of R for Windows is available, its main aim being to support the UTF-8 encoding and especially non-European languages. Check results for CRAN packages are now available on their CRAN results pages. Please help by reviewing these for your package(s) and if a Windows user by trying the new build, particularly if you use a language written in a non-Latin script.
The new build can be downloaded from [2] and instructions are at [1].</description>
