      <description>R 4.4.0, to be released tomorrow, comes with experimental native support for 64-bit ARM Windows machines (aarch64, arm64). Rtools44 with native support for the platform has been released at the beginning of March.
The effort to add Windows/aarch64 support to R has been announced in August, 2023.
Installation R for Windows/aarch64 is distributed separately from the primary distribution for x86_64 (64-bit Intel machines). There is a special installer of R for Windows/aarch64.</description>

      <description>At WWDC 2023 earlier this year, Apple announced it completed transition from Intel to 64-bit ARM processors (Apple Silicon): no new machines with Intel processors will be offered. This was three years after the transition has been announced at WWDC 2020. The work on R support for the platform started the same year and was part of the next R release, R 4.1. See this blog post for details on initial experiments with R on the platform.</description>

      <description>At WWDC 2020 earlier this year, Apple announced a transition from Intel to ARM-based processors in their laptops. This blog is about the prospects of when R will work on that platform, based on experimentation on a developer machine running A12Z, one of the “Apple silicon” processors.
The new platform will include Rosetta 2, a dynamic translation framework which runs binaries built for 64-bit Intel Macs using just-in-time, dynamic translation of binary code.</description>
