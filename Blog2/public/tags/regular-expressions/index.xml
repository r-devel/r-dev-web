      <description>Regular expression operations in R, such as grep or gsub, sometimes have significant performance overheads due to encoding conversions.&#xA;Some R code tries to mitigate this by ignoring input encodings and pretending it is fine to work on individual bytes (via useBytes=TRUE). This removes such overheads, but produces correct results only in special cases, e.g. for simple regular expressions in UTF-8. With the current implementation of gsub and strsplit in R, this can also silently introduce invalid strings, which may cause invalid results or errors in further processing.</description>

      <description>Using \x in string literals is almost always a bad idea, but using it in regular expressions is particularly dangerous.&#xA;Consider this “don’t do” example in R 4.2.1 or earlier:&#xA;text &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;Hello\u00a0R&amp;quot; gsub(&amp;quot;\xa0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, text) a0 is the code point of the Unicode “NO-BREAK SPACE” and the example runs in UTF-8 locale. The intention is to remove the space; a slightly more complicated variant has been discussed on the R-devel mailing list about half a year ago.</description>
