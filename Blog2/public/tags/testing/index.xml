      <title>Debugging Sensitivity to C math library and mingw-w64 v12</title>

      <description>C math library functions, such as exp or sin, are not guaranteed to be “precise”. The results might be slightly different on different platforms. A recent change in mingw-w64 v12, which is a core dependency of compilers we use on Windows (both GCC and LLVM), resulted in failures in about 20 CRAN packages. Rtools45 uses mingw-w64 v11, the same version as Rtools44, to allow time for resolving the issues. The change in mingw-w64 v12 switched about 90 math functions from internal implementations to UCRT, the Windows C runtime provided by Microsoft and shipped with the OS.</description>

      <description>C math library functions, such as exp or sin, are heavily used by R and packages. The C standard doesn’t require these functions to be “precise”. Instead, there is room for performance optimizations causing a reasonable amount of inaccuracy. The results differ between platforms and may change even on a single platform. This happened with mingw-w64 v12, the SDK/runtime used by GCC and LLVM on Windows, which reduced accuracy of many math functions (for performance and maintenance reasons).</description>

      <description>R and R packages on Windows, if they include native code, are built using compiler toolchain and libraries from Rtools. There is always a specific version of Rtools for a given version of R. Rtools44 is used for R 4.4.x, and hence R 4.4.x and packages for that version of R are always built with GCC 13.3 for x86_64 systems and with LLVM 17 for aarch64 systems. This is the case at least since Rtools42 (R 4.</description>

      <title>R on 64-bit ARM Windows</title>

      <description>R 4.4.0, to be released tomorrow, comes with experimental native support for 64-bit ARM Windows machines (aarch64, arm64). Rtools44 with native support for the platform has been released at the beginning of March.
The effort to add Windows/aarch64 support to R has been announced in August, 2023.
Installation R for Windows/aarch64 is distributed separately from the primary distribution for x86_64 (64-bit Intel machines). There is a special installer of R for Windows/aarch64.</description>

      <title>Will R Work on 64-bit ARM Windows?</title>

      <description>At WWDC 2023 earlier this year, Apple announced it completed transition from Intel to 64-bit ARM processors (Apple Silicon): no new machines with Intel processors will be offered. This was three years after the transition has been announced at WWDC 2020. The work on R support for the platform started the same year and was part of the next R release, R 4.1. See this blog post for details on initial experiments with R on the platform.</description>

      <description>If you use R you may have wondered if there are ways you can contribute to making R better. This is another post on how you might help (Reviewing Bug Reports was the first).
This post is about helping with testing of pre-release versions of R.
Maintaining and improving R unavoidably comes with introducing regressions, that is breaking things which worked before. This also happens when external software changes its behavior (OS, compilers, libraries).</description>

      <title>Will R Work on Apple Silicon?</title>

      <description>At WWDC 2020 earlier this year, Apple announced a transition from Intel to ARM-based processors in their laptops. This blog is about the prospects of when R will work on that platform, based on experimentation on a developer machine running A12Z, one of the “Apple silicon” processors.
The new platform will include Rosetta 2, a dynamic translation framework which runs binaries built for 64-bit Intel Macs using just-in-time, dynamic translation of binary code.</description>
