<p>This post presents the most common PROTECT bugs present in packages, based
on manual inspection of ~100 remaining CRAN packages with reports from
<code>rchk</code>.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Any C/C++ code interacting with R, both inside R itself and in packages,
needs to inform the garbage collector about which objects on the R heap are
reachable from local variables. Pointers to such objects are kept on the
pointer protection stack or the precious list or multi-set, but the most
common is the pointer protection stack with <code>PROTECT</code>/<code>UNPROTECT</code> macros.
Failure to protect an object that is later accessed is a common error, which
can lead to incorrect results or a crash, and such bugs are often very hard
to find, because they can be triggered by inconsequential changes that
happen to change when GC is run.</p>
<p>One of the tools that help to find PROTECT errors is
<a href="https://github.com/kalibera/rchk/">rchk</a>, which is run regularly for CRAN
packages and if any potential problem is found, the report is available
under “Additional issues” in CRAN Package Check Results. More information
about the pointer protection API is available in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Garbage-Collection">Writing R
Extensions</a>,
more advice how to use the API is
<a href="https://github.com/kalibera/cran-checks/blob/master/rchk/PROTECT.md">here</a>.
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Using-gctorture">Gctorture</a>
is a runtime tool available in R for discovery of PROTECT errors.</p>
</div>
<div id="running-rchk" class="section level1">
<h1>Running <code>rchk</code></h1>
<p>One can install <code>rchk</code> natively on Linux (tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora),
this is how I use it and the installation procedure should be easy enough to
follow for anyone programming in C. There is also a vagrant script to
install <code>rchk</code> automatically into virtualbox with Ubuntu as guest system
(which would work on host systems including Linux, Windows and macOS).
Recently there is also a pre-built singularity container with rchk (the
guest system is Ubuntu). See <a href="https://github.com/kalibera/rchk/">rchk
documentation</a> for details. Things can
be as simple as</p>
<pre><code>singularity pull --name rchk.img shub://kalibera/rchk:def
singularity run rchk.img jpeg</code></pre>
<p>to check the current CRAN version of package jpeg. One can indeed provide a
tarball instead. Installing system dependencies for R packages that needs
them requires a singularity overlay (covered
<a href="https://github.com/kalibera/rchk/blob/master/doc/SINGULARITY.md">here</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="not-protecting-fresh-objects" class="section level1">
<h1>Not protecting fresh objects</h1>
<p>It is surprisingly not uncommon to see a sequence of calls, particularly
calls to <code>coerceVector()</code> or some macro that wraps it, without the necessary
protection:</p>
<pre><code>SEXP MM = coerceVector(_MM, INTSXP);
SEXP NN = coerceVector(_NN, INTSXP);</code></pre>
<p>Here the second call to <code>coerceVector()</code> may run GC and may destroy <code>MM</code>,
the result of the previous call to <code>coerceVector()</code>. One indeed needs to
protect <code>MM</code> before the second call to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>One should conservatively assume that all functions allocate, and that all
functions which return an <code>SEXP</code> are actually returning a fresh <code>SEXP</code> that
needs protection. The reason is that this can change, allocation or copying
of an object can be introduced on a code path where it did not exist before.
Also, allocation can exist in functions where one would not guess that (e.g. 
reading a variable from a frame, it can run an active binding).</p>
<p><code>rchk</code> still tries hard to find out which functions allocate and does not
report errors when unprotected variables are exposed to functions that don’t
allocate, as far as the tool can see. The reports for this problem say
something like “unprotected variable MM while calling allocating function
Rf_coerceVector”.</p>
</div>
<div id="allocating-argument-expression-with-unprotected-argument" class="section level1">
<h1>Allocating argument expression with unprotected argument</h1>
<p>The caller is always responsible for ensuring that all arguments passed to a
function have been protected. Historically, some core R API functions are
<em>callee-protect</em>, they protect their own arguments and keep them protected
for the whole duration of their call. It is better not to rely on this
property, but it is often done and <code>rchk</code> tries to detect callee-protect
functions and not report an error.</p>
<p>The obvious reason not to rely on this property is because it could change.
There is also then a subtle detail whether the argument is protected until
the end of the function, or only until the last moment when it is needed by
the function, and confusing these two could introduce a bug. A less obvious
reason is that one can easily introduce another error:</p>
<pre><code>lang3(R_BracketSymbol, lang2(R_ClassSymbol, R_NilValue), ScalarReal(cur_class_i + 1)</code></pre>
<p>In this example, a callee-protect function is called with two allocating
arguments. It is true that <code>lang3</code> protects its arguments, but it does not
help: the unprotected result of the call to <code>ScalarInteger()</code> can get
destroyed during the allocating call to <code>lang2()</code>, well before <code>lang3()</code> is
even invoked. This is a very common problem.</p>
<p>Another variant:</p>
<pre><code>setAttrib( ans, install(&quot;class&quot;), mkString2( &quot;srcref&quot;, 6 ) );</code></pre>
<p>Here the object allocated by <code>mkString2()</code> but not protected can get
destroyed by the call to <code>install()</code>. Note that <code>install()</code> places symbols
in the symbol table where the garbage collector can find them, so they do
not have to be protected, but the function still allocates when the symbol
is not yet found in the symbol table. In principle, some common symbols like
“class” in this case will be in the symbol table, because <code>class()</code> is part
of the API, but one should never rely on that.</p>
<p>Less obvious variant:</p>
<pre><code>setAttrib( ans, install(&quot;srcfile&quot;), srcfile );</code></pre>
<p>This is still wrong if <code>srcfile</code> is unprotected. It can be destroyed by the
call to <code>install()</code>. Note that the order of evaluation of function arguments
in C is undefined, so one should not write code that would be correct only
in say the reverse order.</p>
<p><code>rchk</code> reports these errors typically as “Suspicious call (two or more
unprotected arguments) to”, this is from the <code>maacheck</code> tool (part of
<code>rchk</code>). These reports in particular should be taken seriously as they are
very rarely wrong (still, the tool may sometimes conservatively assume that
some complicated function is allocating when it is in fact not).</p>
</div>
<div id="premature-unprotection" class="section level1">
<h1>Premature unprotection</h1>
<p>Several packages have unprotected an object too soon. I am not sure how it
happened, but perhaps it is less error-prone wrt to future code changes to
just unprotect all objects at the end of a function unless there is a real
danger that too much memory would be blocked from re-use for too long.</p>
<pre><code>PROTECT(destVector = allocVector(REALSXP,ssize));
for (i = 0; i &lt; ssize; i++){
   REAL(destVector)[i] = working_space[shift+i];
}
UNPROTECT(1);
PROTECT(f = allocVector(INTSXP,fNPeaks));</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>destVector</code> has been properly protected before being
filled in, but then unprotected, then <code>allocVector()</code> was called, and later
(not shown here) <code>destVector</code> was read again.</p>
<p>A less obvious but common example is when a function assumed not to allocate
is called just before returning from a function:</p>
<pre><code>PROTECT(myint = NEW_INTEGER(len));
p_myint = INTEGER_POINTER(myint);
for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++) p_myint[i] = sigma_0[i];
UNPROTECT(2);
PutRNGstate();
return myint;</code></pre>
<p>Function <code>PutRNGstate()</code> allocates. I know I am repeating myself, but
package writers should not assume for any function that it does not
allocate. These things can be very surprising and they can change, and
change out of their control.</p>
</div>
<div id="passing-unprotected-argument-to-a-normal-function" class="section level1">
<h1>Passing unprotected argument to a normal function</h1>
<p>Arguments have to be protected by the caller. A common error is to pass an
unprotected argument to a function, which then destroys the argument before
using it</p>
<pre><code>PROTECT( ret = NEW_OBJECT(MAKE_CLASS( TIME_CLASS_NAME )));</code></pre>
<p>Here, the argument to <code>NEW_OBJECT()</code> allocated by <code>MAKE_CLASS()</code> can be
destroyed by <code>NEW_OBJECT()</code> before it is read. It has to be protected.</p>
<pre><code>Rf_eval(Rf_lang3(symbols::new_env, Rf_ScalarLogical(TRUE), parent), R_BaseEnv);</code></pre>
<p>Here the argument allocated by <code>Rf_lang3()</code> can be destroyed by <code>Rf_eval()</code>
before being used, it has to be protected before being passed to
<code>Rf_eval()</code>.</p>
<p>These rules indeed also apply to functions defined in a package: functions
taking a number of <code>SEXP</code> arguments should be able to assume that these
arguments are protected.</p>
</div>
<div id="protection-imbalance-on-a-return-branch" class="section level1">
<h1>Protection imbalance on a return branch</h1>
<p>Each function should keep pointer protection balance: when it exits normally
(not via a long jump), the pointer protection stack size should be the same
as when the function has been invoked (and the protection stack should be
the same even wrt to content).</p>
<pre><code>  SEXP sBC = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, rank==0 ? n : 0));
  if (rank == 0) {
    if (REAL(sBC) == NULL) {
        REprintf(&quot;Rank %d: error!\n&quot;, rank);
        return NULL;
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>In this example, on the return path ending with <code>return NULL</code> the function
kept (at least) one extra pointer on the pointer protection stack (in this
example, the branch is actually dead because <code>REAL(sBC)</code> would never be
<code>NULL</code>, but it still illustrates the problem).</p>
<p>Forgetting to unprotect along paths that call <code>return</code> is a common error.
<code>rchk</code> reports pointer protection imbalance in the function (“has possible
protection stack imbalance”), but one needs to find manually where it is
caused (looking for <code>return</code> statements and checking for <code>UNPROTECT</code> around
usually works).</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Writing C code, and specifically C code for R, comes with responsibilities.
One of them is ensuring that R objects are properly PROTECTed (when
programming in R directly, one does not have to worry).</p>
<p><code>rchk</code> results have been available from CRAN for almost two years, and the
CRAN team has been tirelessly reminding package maintainers to check their
reports. The tool cannot find all PROTECT bugs, and particularly so as it
has been tuned to report fewer false alarms. As a result, almost all of the
remaining reports for the CRAN packages now are true errors, and most of
them can be fixed trivially (the hard part is to find where they are, but
that work has already been done).</p>
<p>Many of the remaining false alarms are things that would be good to fix
anyway (e.g. the tool assumes that <code>getAttrib(x, R_NamesSymbol)</code> returns a
fresh object, even though <code>x</code> is of a type that current version of R would
return some object indirectly protected through <code>x</code>).</p>
<p>This post has been written based on manual inspection of all of the
remaining <code>rchk</code> reports for CRAN packages (and obvious bugs were reported
to the package maintainers), in hope that this could make the number of
packages with PROTECT bugs detectable by <code>rchk</code> drop further and stay low.</p>
