<p>This is an update on my previous post <a href="https://blog.r-project.org/2019/05/15/gfortran-issues-with-lapack/index.html">from
May</a>.</p>
<p>A number of things changed since: GFortran started adopting a fix that by
default prevents optimizations which break code calling BLAS/LAPACK
functions from C without hidden length arguments. R has been updated to
internally add these hidden length arguments (and also in other cases where
LTO type mismatch was detected). R has exported macros for use in packages
so that they can follow suit when calling BLAS/LAPACK and CRAN has been
working with maintainers of the affected packages. On the other hand,
binaries of BLAS/LAPACK implementations in Linux distributions started to
emerge with the problem present. OpenBLAS in Fedora 30 is compiled with the
versions of GFortran that still perform the aggressive optimization. Hence,
R packages not yet fixed to provide the hidden arguments may and do crash in
some cases.</p>
<div id="changes-in-gfortran" class="section level1">
<h1>Changes in GFortran</h1>
<p>GFortran 9.2 has been released with a new option <code>-ftail-call-workaround</code>,
which disables tail-call optimization in procedures with character arguments
that call implicitly prototyped procedures. This option is enabled by
default, so GFortran 9.2 is safe again for use with code that doesn’t pass
the hidden lengths to BLAS/LAPACK character arguments (of length 1). One
can also use <code>-ftail-call-workaround=2</code> to disable tail-call optimizations
in all procedures with character arguments. The option is thus less
invasive than <code>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</code>, allowing for tail-call
optimizations in more cases, but on the other hand it is declared to be
likely withdrawn in some future release of Fortran. Also it is declared
that the default for the option may change. The option has already been
added also to GFortran 7 and GFortran 8, but those have not been yet
released with the change. Credits to Jakub Jelinek for implementing this
new option.</p>
<p>R does not yet use the new option, but instead still uses the more
conservative option <code>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</code>. It would be possible to
switch to the new option based on a configure test that would check whether
it is available, reverting to <code>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</code> if that was not
the case.</p>
<p>The key benefit of this (possibly temporary) option for R is that it is
enabled by default: LAPACK and BLAS implementations that have note been
explicitly built with <code>-fno-optimize-sibling-calls</code> nor another option
preventing the dangerous optimizations would for some time become safe again
to use even from R packages that have not yet been fixed. The same applies
well beyond R, even LAPACKE and CBLAS need to be fixed.</p>
</div>
<div id="changes-in-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Changes in R</h1>
<p>The headers for BLAS and LAPACK included with R have been extended so that C
declarations of BLAS and LAPACK functions include also the hidden length
arguments. All calls to BLAS and LAPACK from C code of R itself have been
fixed to pass this argument (it is always <code>1</code> for the computational
functions). This work has been done by Brian Ripley.</p>
<p>The actual type of the hidden length argument and whether it is to be used
or not is configurable via macros in R (<code>FCONE</code>, <code>FC_LEN_T</code>, internally
<code>FCLEN</code> in function declarations) and is Fortran-compiler dependent. R
detects at build time whether the argument is to be used by the Fortran
compiler R is being built with, but it considers only <code>size_t</code> as the type.
GFortran 7 used <code>int</code>, but for the purpose of passing <code>1</code>, which is in fact
never read, and for the purpose of providing a “scratch” space for the
callee to pass another <code>1</code>, which will be never read, using a wider type is
fine.</p>
<p>This is not only simpler than properly detecting the exact type, but also
safer, because when R uses an external BLAS/LAPACK implementation (not the
reference one included in R), we have no control over how that one has been
built and the selection is done at runtime/dynamic linking time. Moreover,
optimized BLAS/LAPACK implementations may replace some functions by custom
implementations in C, while other functions (typically from LAPACK) will
re-use the reference Fortran implementation, hence some functions will need
the hidden argument but other not. As current compilers typically use a
64-bit hidden length argument, <code>size_t</code> is a safer choice. Note also that
on 64-bit CPUs, 64-bit slack slots will typically be used even for <code>int</code>
arguments.</p>
</div>
<div id="changes-in-r-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Changes in R packages</h1>
<p>R packages should also be fixed to provide the hidden length arguments when
calling from C to Fortran. CRAN now does an additional check using <code>LTO</code>,
reporting LTO type mismatches when these problems still exist, and package
authors are being asked to fix those. Many packages have already been fixed,
sometimes with the help of the CRAN team.</p>
<p>Packages may fix their calls to BLAS and LAPACK using the same new macros
that R uses in its code (<code>FCONE</code>, <code>FC_LEN_T</code>, <code>USE_FC_LEN_T</code>). This is
documented in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Fortran-character-strings">Writing R
Extensions</a>.
These macros can be used also in those packages that for whichever reason
chose to include their own version of LAPACK or even BLAS.</p>
<p>Alternatively, package authors may also use <code>iso_c_binding</code> (Fortran 2003)
to create Fortran functions with standardized calling convention from C, as
mentioned in the previous version of this blog and now also in Writing R
Extensions.</p>
<p>Calls from Fortran to BLAS and LAPACK are not affected: the hidden length
arguments will be correctly added by the Fortran compiler. To be safe, both
the client code and BLAS/LAPACK need to be built by the same Fortran
compiler, but in practice many compilers will be compatible and GFortran
will add the hidden lengths, which as noted seems currently safe to do even
when they are not expected.</p>
<p>I have seen and debugged an example where a package called to BLAS/LAPACK
both from C (without the proper lengths) and from Fortran. The LTO type
mismatch warnings seemed to suggest that the calls from Fortran were wrong, but
that was not the case, that warning appeared because of incorrect calls from
C that however matched the (old and incorrect) headers without the hidden
length arguments.</p>
<p>Note we have considered also alternative solutions to the problem, primarily
looking for some that would not require modification of source code of
packages that call into BLAS/LAPACK. I’ve experimented with a C
preprocessor solution based on meta-programming tricks (started from an
if-then-else implementation in the C preprocessor), which allowed automatic
rewriting of some calls using <code>F77_CALL</code> macro in the usual form of
<code>F77_CALL(foo)(x)</code>, while leaving other calls intact. This worked on simple
examples, but would have been difficult to debug for package authors if
problems appeared and it has been far from simple. Also, some packages
insist on including their own version of LAPACK/BLAS and those would have to
be adjusted anyway, possibly with more effort. Also the alternative
solution could have a surprising effect in case of (yet unlikely) re-use of
the name of a BLAS/LAPACK function for something else. The solution adopted
in R, while it requires packages to be updated manually, is intentionally
very simple.</p>

<div id="changes-in-linux-distributions" class="section level1">
<h1>Changes in Linux distributions</h1>
<p>It always takes some time after a GCC release before it is used to build
binary packages for Linux distributions. As only the 9.x series now has a
release with <code>-ftail-call-workaround</code> and this release (9.2) is quite
recent, Linux distributions unfortunately can be expected to come soon with
BLAS/LAPACK implementations compiled with the aggressive optimizations;
applications not passing hidden character lengths, including R packages not
yet fixed, are expected to crash or work incorrectly. This has already been
seen on Fedora 30 with OpenBLAS.</p>
<p>Fedora 30 now comes with OpenBLAS with this problem (all versions including
the <code>libRblas.so</code> replacement, serial, OpenMP, threaded). OpenBLAS in
Fedora 29, Ubuntu 19.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 10 and Debian 9 seems to be
ok. Reference (netlib) LAPACK in Fedora 30, Fedora 29, Ubuntu 19.04, Ubuntu
18.04, Debian 10 and Debian 9 seems fine.</p>
<p>These observations are likely to change, unfortunately in the short term for
both the worse and the better. The only defense for R packages is to
correctly pass the hidden length argument. Still, it would make sense if
BLAS/LAPACK implementations in Linux distributions were all rebuilt in a way
so that the lengths were not required.</p>
