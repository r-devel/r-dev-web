<p>The upcoming release of R (version 4.2.0) features several
enhancements to the HTML help system.</p>
<p>The most noticeable features are that LaTeX-like mathematical
equations in help pages are now typeset using either
<a href="https://katex.org">KaTeX</a> or <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a>, and
usage and example code are highlighted using
<a href="https://prismjs.com">Prism</a>. Additionally, the output of examples and
demos can now be shown within the browser if the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr">knitr</a> package is
installed. This is especially useful if the examples produce graphical
output. Apart from these, several less noticeable changes have been
made to improve useablity.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to introduce these enhancements, and
request testing of these features during the run-up to the release of
R 4.2.0 so that as many bugs can be taken care of before release as possible.</p>
<div id="rendering-of-mathematics" class="section level2">
<h2>Rendering of mathematics</h2>
<p>The R documentation format supports LaTeX-like mathematics through the
<code>\eqn{}</code> and <code>\deqn{}</code> commands. Historically, these have been
rendered properly when converted to PDF (via LaTeX), but not when
converted to other formats. However, support for rendering mathematics
in HTML has matured over time, and in particular the
<a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> and <a href="https://katex.org">KaTeX</a>
Javascript libraries are stable and popular solutions. In fact,
several R packages provide indirect support for mathematics in R
documentation, notably
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=mathjaxr">mathjaxr</a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=katex">katex</a>. Naturally, both of
these require special markup.</p>
<p>From R 4.2.0, <code>\eqn{}</code> and <code>\deqn{}</code> commands can be rendered as
mathematics in HTML output, using either KaTeX or MathJax. The details
can be controlled using the <code>help.htmlmath</code> option. For dynamic help,
the default is equivalent to setting</p>
<pre class="r"><code>options(help.htmlmath = &quot;katex&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>which uses a local copy of KaTeX that ships with R. The
<code>help.htmlmath</code> option can also be set to <code>"mathjax"</code>; in this case,
if the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=mathjaxr">mathjaxr</a> package
is installed then its local copy of MathJax is used, otherwise an
online CDN is used. If the option is set to any other non-NULL value,
the displayed pages will fall back to the basic substitutions that
were used previously.</p>
<p>Static HTML output, if enabled, will always use KaTeX via a CDN (as
relative paths to a local copy cannot be reliably computed).</p>
</div>
<div id="code-highlighting" class="section level2">
<h2>Code highlighting</h2>
<p>R now ships with Javascript and CSS files downloaded from
<a href="https://prismjs.com/" class="uri">https://prismjs.com/</a> to provide syntax highlighting of R code in the
Usage and Examples sections in R help pages. Such code are now marked
with a <code>&lt;code class='language-R'&gt;</code> tag, which are processed and
rendered using the Prism Javascript and CSS.</p>
<p>Syntax highlighting is currently disabled for static HTML output,
again due to the difficulty in computing relative paths, and the lack
of a CDN.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples-and-demos" class="section level2">
<h2>Examples and demos</h2>
<p>R provides specific facilities to run two types of example code
included in package documentation, namely examples and demos, via the
<code>example()</code> and <code>demo()</code> functions respectively. The example code is
shown as part of the corresponding help page, and demos can be
accessed via dynamic help through the packageâ€™s index page. Versions
of R prior to 4.2.0 provided no option to run the examples via the
dynamic help system. Demos could be run by clicking a link, but the
result was to run the demo in the console.</p>
<p>Displaying the result of running examples or demos within the help
system has certain obvious benefits, especially if the output contains
graphics. While this is a fairly non-trivial task, the powerful
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=mathjaxr">knitr</a> package makes it
quite simple.</p>
<p>If the knitr package is installed, R 4.2.0 will include links in help
pages that allow its examples to be run, which when clicked will run
the examples as a <code>.Rhtml</code> document and display the output as an HTML
page. Such pages can be also be created directly by accessing links of
the form</p>
<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt;/library/&lt;PKG&gt;/Example/&lt;TOPIC&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Previously available demo links of the form</p>
<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:&lt;PORT&gt;/library/&lt;PKG&gt;/Demo/&lt;TOPIC&gt;</code></pre>
<p>will similarly display output in the browser instead of running the
demo in the console.</p>
<p>Both the <code>example()</code> and <code>demo()</code> functions have a new <code>type</code> argument,
which can be set to <code>"html"</code> to show output in a browser instead of
the console using links of this form.</p>
<p>One caveat that may be considered either a feature or a bug depending
on your perspective: The code to create the HTML output using knitr
sets some but not all knitr options. This means that the output may be
affected by settings previously modified by the user. For example, if
one sets</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = &quot;svg&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(svglite)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = &quot;svglite&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>then the embedded images will be SVG instead of PNG (which in most
cases will be an improvement). Similarly, loading packages that define
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr/vignettes/knit_print.html">additional methods for
<code>knit_print()</code></a>
may change the output from how it would have appeared in the console.</p>
</div>
<div id="html5" class="section level2">
<h2>HTML5</h2>
<p>Help pages are now HTML5, the current HTML standard, which in particular
helps facilitating some of the enhancements described previously (and in
the future may be used for additional enhancements).</p>
<p>Considerable effort was put into ensuring creating <em>valid</em> HTML5. The
old validation toolchain could not handle HTML5, so a new one was
created based on <a href="https://www.html-tidy.org/">HTML Tidy</a> and integrated
into the tools package.</p>
<p>Validation not only identified HTML generation issues in R, but also Rd
markup problems in add-on packages, often from outputting raw HTML. So
a new check for the validity of the package HTML help pages was added
which is turned on for the CRAN submission checks, and can generally be
activated by setting env var <code>_R_CHECK_RD_VALIDATE_RD2HTML_</code> to
something true. (This needs HTML tidy available on the system path for
executables. The checks are currently not performed for Rd pages
generated by roxygen2, which still needs updating for the HTML changes.)</p>
<p>These checks report validation problems for the generated HTML, and
relating these to the Rd sources is not always immediate. In such
cases, what seems to work best is calling <code>help(&lt;TOPIC&gt;, help_type = "html")</code> on a TOPIC from the offending Rd file, and then use the browser
to view the HTML source. This allows to identify the context, and in
fact, often already highlights invalid content.</p>
<p>R help pages now also add the viewport meta tag inside <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which
improves rendering and zooming on mobile devices.</p>
</div>
<div id="stylesheet" class="section level2">
<h2>Stylesheet</h2>
<p>The <code>R.css</code> stylesheet that is used to style R help pages features
some simple improvements. More usefully, dynamic help now serves the
copy of <code>R.css</code> located in <code>$R_HOME/doc/html/R.css</code> rather than the
copy created for every package during installation (the latter is
still necessary for static HTML). This means that any local changes
made to <code>$R_HOME/doc/html/R.css</code> after R is installed will affect all
help pages subsequently displayed through the dynamic help system. For
example, one might include</p>
<pre><code>@import url(&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>at the top of <code>R.css</code> to include the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap
4</a>
CSS. Note that this does not affect RStudioâ€™s built-in browser, which
uses its own styling.</p>
</div>
<div id="disabling" class="section level2">
<h2>Disabling</h2>
<p>Many of these enhancements can be disabled by setting the environment
variable <code>_R_HELP_ENABLE_ENHANCED_HTML_</code> to a false value.</p>
