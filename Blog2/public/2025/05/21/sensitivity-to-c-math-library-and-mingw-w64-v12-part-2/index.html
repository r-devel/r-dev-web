<p>C math library functions, such as <code>exp</code> or <code>sin</code>, are not guaranteed to be
“precise”. The results might be slightly different on different platforms.
A recent change in mingw-w64 v12, which is a core dependency of compilers we
use on Windows (both GCC and LLVM), resulted in failures in about 20 CRAN
packages. Rtools45 uses mingw-w64 v11, the same version as Rtools44, to
allow time for resolving the issues. The change in mingw-w64 v12 switched
about 90 math functions from internal implementations to UCRT, the Windows C
runtime provided by Microsoft and shipped with the OS. The goal of the
change was improving performance and reducing maintenance cost of mingw-w64.</p>
<p>Interested readers should first read the previous
<a href="https://blog.r-project.org/2025/04/24/sensitivity-to-c-math-library-and-mingw-w64-v12">blog post on the
topic</a>.
This post presents additional observations.</p>
<div id="results-differ-between-windows-versions" class="section level2">
<h2>Results differ between Windows versions</h2>
<p>Four CRAN packages failed on (two independent) CRAN servers, both running
the latest version of Windows Server 2022, but they passed their tests on a
Windows 10 system. It turned out that the failures were due to math
functions returning different values on Windows Server 2022 compared to
Windows 10.</p>
<p>For example, <code>exp(-0x1.7411ffffffff6p+9)</code> was exact zero on a Windows Server
2022 machine, but <code>0x0.0000000000001p-1022</code> on Windows 10. The latter is a
correctly rounded result according to mpfr</p>
<pre><code>&gt; library(Rmpfr)
&gt; sprintf(&quot;%a&quot;, as.double(exp(mpfr(-0x1.7411ffffffff6p+9, precBits=53))))
[1] &quot;0x1p-1074</code></pre>
<p>and was returned with mingw-w64 v11 (the R function exp() in this case
simply calls the corresponding C function). The result is a subnormal
number very close to zero, so tests/algorithms shouldn’t be sensitive to
that difference. They were in case of three of the failing packages, and the
issues were reported to the authors.</p>
<p>At least in two cases it was via assumptions about what is the smallest <code>x</code>
such that <code>exp(x) &gt; 0</code>. In one case, the result of such numerical
computation was about <code>-744.03</code> on Windows Server 2022 and <code>-745.13</code> on
Windows 10, which is already very visible difference. The computation
corresponds to what <code>uniroot</code> does in base R (see <code>?uniroot</code>, look at the
examples) and is very sensitive to the accuracy of <code>exp()</code>. Focusing on the
individual computations done when iteratively approximating this number on
the two systems, on Windows Server 2022 the smallest subnormal returned by
<code>exp</code> was surprisingly <code>0x0.0000000000002p-1022</code>. On Windows 10 it was
unsurprisingly <code>0x0.0000000000001p-1022</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve confirmed this difference on systems running Windows natively to rule
out any influence of virtualization.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some influence of virtualization. Interestingly, a Windows 10 VM
behaving as above started behaving more like Windows Server 2022, returning
plain zero in the <code>exp</code> example, in a newer version of virtualbox, and the
four packages seen failing on Windows Server 2022 were also failing there.
Downgrading back to older virtualbox restored the previous behavior. It
might be interesting to follow this hint to find out the true cause for the
difference, but for the purpose of testing R packages and preparing them for
next mingw-w64, the true cause doesn’t matter: R and packages need to work
reliably also on (at least native) systems set up like these.</p>
</div>
<div id="windows-server-2022-ucrt-wasnt-always-less-precise" class="section level2">
<h2>Windows Server 2022 UCRT wasn’t always less precise</h2>
<p>My experiments did not suggest that more packages would have been failing
with mingw-w64 v12 on Windows Server 2022 than on Windows 10. The full CRAN
checks were ran on the server, and then the failing packages were debugged
on Windows 10 (when the problem could be reproduced) or on Windows Server
2022 (when it could not be). Running the full CRAN checks on a desktop
system would take too long.</p>
<p>As a concrete example to illustrate this, the result of
<code>sin(0x1.921f154161812p-1)</code> was <code>0x1.6a097542c0b21p-1</code> on a Windows Server
2022 system, but <code>0x1.6a097542c0b22p-1</code> on a Windows 10 system. The former
result is correctly rounded (“precise”) according to mpfr and is also what I
get on Linux and with mingw-w64 v11. So the Windows 10 system was (very
slightly) imprecise.</p>
</div>
<div id="ucrt-is-not-always-less-precise" class="section level2">
<h2>UCRT is not always less precise</h2>
<p>My experiments did not suggest that UCRT would be always less precise than
the internal implementations in mingw-w64. I’ve been looking only at newly
failing packages with mingw-w64 v12, I’ve been looking at due to which math
functions they were failing and how much those functions changed their
results. I looked at whether the trivial changes (within 1 ULP, or the
smallest possible absolute difference with the subnormals above) were the
ones to cause the failure. But I wasn’t looking at possible improvements in
precision: I would only find them if they broke some tests, but they didn’t
and it would be surprising if they did.</p>
<p>As a concrete example to illustrate this, <code>sin(-0x1.ffffffff36f02p+32)</code> is
<code>-0x1.64b688aec8cb4p-3</code> according to mpfr, which is exactly the same value I
got with mingw-w64 v12 on Windows 10. But, the internal implementation in
mingw-w64 v11 yields <code>-0x1.64b688af2894dp-3</code>, which is 392345 ulps away.
This and other extreme differences between <code>sin()</code> in v11 and v12 have been
found, but didn’t cause any test failures. Unsurprisingly, as tests are
probably typically based also on results observed on Windows at some point.
But, yet still, had someone found about this earlier, such big inaccuracy
would certainly be worth reporting upstream.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Readers interested in testing computed results are advised to read also
“Writing portable packages” in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html">Writing R
Extensions</a>.
Look for paragraph starting with: “Only test the accuracy of results if you
have done a formal error analysis.”</p>
<p>When tolerances are established empirically, one should probably at least
test on different Windows systems (once Rtools use mingw-w64 newer than v11,
assuming the use of UCRT functions remains unconditional there). One should
also be prepared to see differences due to virtualization.</p>
<p>UCRT is linked dynamically to R and R packages (when using GCC or LLVM).
Hence, any system update in principle could change UCRT and the accuracy of
math functions implemented there. This is a new thing: previously (up to
v11, so including Rtools45), the internal implementations of math functions
in mingw-w64 would be linked statically and be used on all Windows systems.</p>
