<p>When using R interactively from the command line, one can interrupt the
current computionation using <code>Ctrl+C</code> key combination and enter a new
command. This works both on Unix terminal and on Windows console in Rterm.
Such computation may be implemented in R or C and may be executing an
external command while waiting for the result e.g. via
<code>system(,wait=TRUE)</code>.</p>
<p>However, in R 4.3 and earlier, <code>Ctrl+C</code> interrupts also background tasks,
e.g. those executed via <code>system(,wait=FALSE)</code> or <code>pipe()</code>. This was
reported in <a href="https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17764">PR#17764</a> for
Unix, but it turned out to be a happening also on Windows. Such background
tasks do not prevent the user to enter a new R command to the REPL
(read-eval-print loop). Often they do not produce any output and the user
may not even be aware of them. Such tasks are not interrupted in other
systems with a REPL, including the Unix shell. The problem has been fixed
in R-devel, the development version of R.</p>
<div id="the-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>This text abstracts out some details in the interest of readability.</p>
<p>When the user presses <code>Ctrl+C</code>, some processes receive a signal from the
operating system. The signal may be ignored, then nothing happens. It may
also have a default or non-default handler. The default handler terminates
the process. A non-default handler may be provided by the application.</p>
<p>R when running interactively with the REPL doesn’t want to terminate in
response to <code>Ctrl+C</code>. It hence has its own handler. The handler just takes
a note that an interrupt is pending and lets the main computation continue.
Once it is safe to respond to a user interrupt, but not too often to also
get something else done, R checks whether there is any pending interrupt,
and if so, responds to it. In practice it means R needs to check for
pending interrupts time to time in long running loops. It has to specially
handle blocking calls to the OS, so that it doesn’t take too long to e.g. 
interrupt a computation.</p>
<p>R itself may, however, be also ran to execute an R script. It can be from
another instance of R via <code>system(,wait=TRUE)</code> or from other applications.
In such cases, R should be terminated by <code>Ctrl+C</code>. But, when ran say via
<code>system(,wait=FALSE)</code> or similarly from another application, it should not
be terminated by <code>Ctrl+C</code> (the bug report). Hence, there needs to be an
application-independent way to communicate what <code>Ctrl+C</code> should do to the
child process, and this should be inherited further to its child processes.</p>
<p>Such a way of communication is provided by the operating system. The parent
process may be able to arrange that its given child process (and its
children) do not receive the signal for <code>Ctrl+C</code>. Also, the parent process
may be able to arrange that its given child process (and its children) will
ignore the signal for the interrupt.</p>
<p>For this to work, applications need to cooperate. By default, they do.
When an application does not set any signal handler and leaves the flag on
ignoring the signal alone, it inherits the intended behavior: either it
terminates in response to the interrupt via the default handler action, or
it continues executing as the signal does not arrive or is ignored.</p>
<p>Applications, such as R, that set their own interrupt handler, have to be
more careful. They need to avoid installing/enabling their handler when the
inherited flag says the signal should be ignored. And they need to ensure
the flag is set correctly for its child processes.</p>
</div>
<div id="on-unix" class="section level1">
<h1>On Unix</h1>
<p>The information that a signal is ignored is encoded by a special handler
named <code>SIG_IGN</code>. A real signal handler itself cannot be inherited, because
it lives in the address space of the parent process, but when it is set to
<code>SIG_IGN</code>, it is inherited.</p>
<p>One can find out whether the signal is ignored or not using <code>sigaction()</code>,
and when it is ignored, one should not set any custom handler. The older
<code>signal()</code> call returns the previous signal handler when setting a new one,
so one should immediately restore the old one if it was <code>SIG_IGN</code>. A good
source on signal handling on Unix is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Signal-Handling.html">GNU libc
documentation</a>,
which mentions also this principle. R was fixed to do this.</p>
<p>The <code>SIGINT</code> signal is sent by the terminal in response to <code>Ctrl+C</code> to the
foreground process group it controls. All processes in the group receive the
signal. Each process is in exactly one process group and by default, its
child processes are in the same group.</p>
<p>R’s <code>system(,wait=FALSE)</code>, as documented, runs the background process using
a Unix (POSIX) shell <code>/bin/sh</code>, running the given command with <code>&amp;</code> appended
to it. Typically a shell invoked this way will have job control disabled
(a.k.a monitor mode disabled), which means that its child process (the
command) will execute in the same process group but with the <code>SIGINT</code> signal
ignored, so that while it would receive <code>Ctrl+C</code>, it won’t be interrupted by
it.</p>
<p>This mechanism would have been sufficient to ensure that <code>Ctrl+C</code> does not
interrupt background tasks in R, if all applications did follow the rule of
respecting ignored <code>SIGINT</code>, but they don’t, including older versions of R,
so further robustification is needed.</p>
<p>When the Unix shell job control is enabled, the shell executes background
tasks in a new process group. Hence, they don’t receive a signal when
<code>Ctrl+C</code> is pressed, so they are not interrupted even when not abiding by
the rule. The implementation of R’s <code>system(,wait=FALSE)</code> cannot use
<code>/bin/sh</code> with the job control enabled, but it can arrange for the child
process (the <code>/bin/sh</code>) to run in a new process group.</p>
<p>R already had the key pieces in place to run a command in a new process
group, because it is already had to do it with <code>system(,timeout&gt;0)</code> via a
re-implementation of C/POSIX <code>system()</code>. This code has been slightly
generalized and now even <code>system(,wait=FALSE)</code> runs the child processes in a
new process group.</p>
<p>While in principle the problem is the same with <code>pipe()</code>, making that more
robust required more work. The implementation of <code>pipe()</code> used C/POSIX
calls <code>popen()</code> and <code>pclose()</code>, which however did not allow to request a new
process group. Therefore, <code>popen()</code> and <code>pclose()</code> had to be newly
re-implemented inside R code base.</p>
</div>
<div id="on-windows" class="section level1">
<h1>On Windows</h1>
<p>The information that a signal for <code>Ctrl+C</code> (and some other events) is
ignored is inherited by child processes, but there is no documented way to
obtain it from the operating system. It is stored in PEB (Process
Environment Block), under process parameters, in <code>ConsoleFlags</code>, but while
some terminal implementations use it, it is not in the public API.</p>
<p>However, unlike Unix, Windows keeps this information separately from the
actual signal handler. It is hence safe to set a handler (via
<code>SetConsoleCtrlHandler</code>) unconditionally. The handler will only be used
when the signal is not ignored. And the handler itself, indeed, will not be
inherited, because it is an address in the address space of the process.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, an application such as R may need to ensure that it
won’t be interrupted by <code>Ctrl+C</code>. <code>R.exe</code> is a separate application, which
executes <code>Rterm.exe</code>. When R is meant to be used interactively with a REPL,
it should not be terminated by <code>Ctrl+C</code>. In other words, <code>Rterm.exe</code> should
take care of interrupting the current computation and <code>R.exe</code> should do
nothing (but definitely not terminate) on <code>Ctrl+C</code>. This used to be
implemented by ignoring the signal in <code>R.exe</code> and then unignoring it in
<code>Rterm.exe</code> (via <code>SetConsoleCtrlHandler(NULL,)</code>). This corrupted the
inherited yet unretrievable flag telling whether the signal was ignored or
not.</p>
<p>R has been fixed so that to “ignore” <code>Ctrl+C</code>, <code>R.exe</code> now installs its own
handler for the signal. The handler only returns TRUE, which has the same
effect as ignoring the signal, but it does not corrupt the inherited flag.
The dangerous calls to <code>SetConsoleCtrlHandler(NULL,)</code> have been removed. I
believe this is a pattern that should be followed on Windows, but I did not
find any recommendation to this effect in Microsoft documentation nor
elsewhere.</p>
<p>In addition, when R executes a background process that should not be
interrupted via <code>Ctrl+C</code> (e.g. <code>system(,wait=FALSE)</code>), it needs to ensure
that the child ignores the signal. This can be done via a process creation
flag <code>CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP</code> and R does that now.</p>
<p>However, process groups are not the same thing as on Unix. This doesn’t
“group” processes, it only ensures that the child executes with the signal
ignored. This property is inherited by child processes, but any child
process may change it using <code>SetConsoleCtrlHandler(NULL,)</code>, so it would then
be interrupted by <code>Ctrl+C</code> again. Windows allows to actually “group”
processes, into “jobs”, but that does not help in this case.</p>
<p>R on Windows already used its own implementation of an alternative to C
<code>system()</code> for executing external processes. This was extended to use
<code>CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP</code> with background processes (e.g. 
<code>system(,wait=FALSE)</code>.</p>
<p>More work was again needed to fix <code>pipe()</code>. R with Rterm as console used
the C <code>popen()</code> and <code>pclose()</code> calls, which did not allow to ignore the
interrupt in the child processes. R with a GUI (e.g. Rgui) already used
its own implementation of <code>pipe()</code>, which is now used also on the console,
but had to be generalized.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Additional technical details on these changes can be found on <a href="https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17764">R
Bugzilla</a> and in the
source code. Any regressions related to execution of background processes
should be reported so that they could be fixed before the next R release.</p>
<p>A known limitation on Windows is that applications directly calling
<code>SetConsoleCtrlHandler(NULL,)</code> may still be terminated by <code>Ctrl+C</code> even when
not desirable. This includes applications linked against the Cygwin/Msys2
runtime (so also Rtools).</p>
<p>Users on Unix may observe differences in behavior of job control or when
background processes read from or write to the terminal, but these should be
far less annoying than <code>Ctrl+C</code> killing background processes.</p>
