First, thank you very much for that lattice-package, second, the code
below segfaults R:

zz <- data.frame(
                 y=rnorm(100),x=rnorm(100),z=round(rnorm(100)),
                 g=as.character(rep(1:2,50)))
xyplot(y~ x|z,data=zz,groups=g,
            panel = function(x, y, subscripts, groups)  
            grid.text(x=x, y=y, label=groups[subscripts])
       )

I'm not sure if I have understood that panel stuff right, but anyway,
it shouldn't segfault. BTW: I also unsure if I have to use the
develop-version of R & whether lattice bugs should be submitted
(because of the devel-status??).

Peter

Well, it is easier for us to deal with erroneously submitted bug than
erroneously unsubmitted ones. We have an Add-Ons category on r-bugs to
put it in. 

Lattice is closely associated with the core team, so we'd be able to
track this kind of problem. With some other packages which we do not
maintain, we have some trouble figuring out whether a report has been
solved or whether it was even a bug in the first place (it would be
nice if the original submitters would lend a hand there).

As I remember it, Paul and Deepayan were somewhat vague about exactly
what was required, except that you'd need something relatively recent.
A segfault certainly looks like a real bug.

...and your example crashes with the current development version of R
too, anyway.

grid.text() seems unhappy with being passed a non-character vector for
the label argument. I think Paul muttered something to the effect that
he knew there would be that kind of weaknesses in the code.

The following runs successfully (well, at least it doesn't crash - the
result looks a bit weird):

library(lattice)
zz <- data.frame(
                 y=rnorm(100),x=rnorm(100),z=round(rnorm(100)),
                 g=as.character(rep(1:2,50)))
xyplot(y~ x|z,data=zz,groups=g,
            panel = function(x, y, subscripts, groups)
            grid.text(x=x, y=y,
                      label=as.character(groups[subscripts]))
       )

The results look weird because the x and y locations in grid.text are in
"npc" units by default (that is, they are taken as proportions of the
dimensions of the region they are being drawn in).  This means that values
outside the range 0..1 are drawn outside the limits of the plotting region.
You need to specify "native" units in the call so that the x and y locations
are relative to the scales on the axes of the plotting region.  For example,

    grid.text(x=x, y=y,
                  label=as.character(groups[subscripts]),
                  default.units="native")

This unit stuff is a "feature" of the underlying grid graphics, which is
probably why you did not notice it.  The default panel functions do,
however, provide examples of what needs to be done.  See, for example,
panel.xyplot.

There seems to be a problem with the background margins (I only recognized it in a latex ):

xyplot(rnorm(100) ~ rnorm(100))
dev.print(postscript,"/tmp/tmp.ps")

whereas this works on the 1.2.3 version but not with 1.3.0:

dev.copy2eps("/tmp/tmp.ps")                 

both times a warning appears:
Warning message:

Subject: read.xport() bug

Full_Name: Aimee Teo Broman
Version: 1.23
OS: Windows 98
Submission from: (NULL) (162.129.145.115)


When I use the read.xport() function in the foreign library, the Rgui shuts
down.   My xport file was created in SAS ver.6, using the xport engine in proc
copy. 

R commands:
1. library(foreign)
2. lookup.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this works fine.
3. read.xport("fdt.tpt")  <-- this produces a window that says "This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down."  The details are shown
below:

RGUI caused an invalid page fault in
module FOREIGN.DLL at 017f:14c727e7.
Registers:
EAX=00000000 CS=017f EIP=14c727e7 EFLGS=00010246
EBX=034a1320 SS=0187 ESP=0270f404 EBP=0270f46c
ECX=00000000 DS=0187 ESI=00000006 FS=1847
EDX=034a1338 ES=0187 EDI=034a1335 GS=0000
Bytes at CS:EIP:
c6 00 00 83 c4 fc 83 c4 10 39 d8 75 09 a1 48 02 
Stack dump:
034a1320 00000020 034b5a50 78037ce8 02c5cf68 00000002 0270f4ac 004250ae 00585140
02c5c728 0270f46c 00000079 00000001 0348c150 0348e9d0 78037ce8 

The date on the foreign.zip file is 18-May-2001, so I believe I have the most
recent version of both R and the foreign package.  I would call this an
intermittant problem, except that I have this problem more frequently than not.
Yesterday it was working, but today it is shutting down the gui again.  Any help
would be appreciated.

thanks much,
Aimee Broman

All packages have a version number, in their DESCRIPTION file or via

package.description("foreign")$Version

I suspect this is 0.4-3, but please confirm.

We do need a reproducible example to make any sense of this bug report, and
for that we need fdt.tpt.  Could you please attach that file to your reply.

Yes, the version of the foreign package is 0.4-3 .

I've found that the problem is with a particular variable in the
dataset--a character variable containing names.  If I remove this
variable from the rest of the dataset, the transfer file reads in
fine.  I attach a transfer file with just the name variable, in the
case that you'd like to take a look at it.

Thanks very much,
Aimee

I found that predict.gnls failed with a wierd error message about a
non-numeric argument to a binary vector in one of three nearly identical
uses.

Error in Inh/Ki : non-numeric argument to binary operator

(Inh and Ki are arguments to the function used in the formula for the
object whose predictions were requested).

It turns out that the problem is in getCovariateFormula().

The final line in getCovariateFormula() in the nlme package (version
3.1-16) is:
    eval(parse(text = paste("~", deparse(form))))

however, if deparse(form) exceeds 'width.cutoff (which defaults to 60)',
this results in inappropriately placed "~" signs:
For example, in my application with the error, form is

UnCompetitive(MethoxyresorufinConc, InhibitorConc, Vmax, Km, Ki)

the result of the paste() operation in the last line of getCovariateFormula
is:

> paste("~",deparse(form))
[1] "~ UnCompetitive(MethoxyresorufinConc, InhibitorConc, Vmax, Km, "
[2] "~     Ki)"

extending width.cutoff gives the intended value:

> paste("~",deparse(form,width.cutoff=500))
[1] "~ UnCompetitive(MethoxyresorufinConc, InhibitorConc, Vmax, Km, Ki)"

Seems a bit risky for an enforced cutoff in deparse, though.

parse(...deparse(...)) always looks wrong to me anyway. Couldn't one
use something like

f <- ~1
f[[2]] <- form
eval(f)

or 

eval(as.call(list(as.name("~"),form)))

or

eval(substitute(~form)) # that's not going to work in S, though...

??

(What is the eval for? Doesn't usually do anything to a
formula argument.)

Exactly.  The code was originally written for S and ported to R.  Some
of the contorted expressions were things that we found by
experimentation would work in both systems.

In Sv3 at least it assigns a class to the object.

I'll change it to eval(substitute(~form)) for the R package.

It looks clunky, but you could maintain consistency across S and R forms
with

eval(parse(text=paste("~",paste(deparse(form),collapse=" "))))

Aha. In R too.

Great. I would have thought that one of the two other forms would be
portable, though.

There is a bug in the polymars code.  

Line 655   m=m+k-1;

ought to be moved in front of the for loop in line 652 or else the levels array
will go out of bounds in the loop.

This does not seem to cause any errors in R, but caused crashes when I attempted
to link the file to PV-wave.

I asked Prof. Brian Ripley if I might submit some text/input for the
R-intro writers, he said this is the place to do it.

I was on a plane a couple of weeks ago reading R-intro as I plan for a
course and made these notes, some of which I think will help my students
if you incorporate them.  I've attached a raw text file I wrote in Emacs
to this message "Rintrochanges.txt".

I have written documents like R-intro before and understand it is
difficult to please everybody, and I thank you for your effort on the
project.

R-intro comments/enhancements  Part I.

I think something more verbose like this would help under
"Ordered and Unordered factors"

Texts on research design emphasize that variables have
different levels of measurement. Typically, there are three levels.
If a measurement is taken with a precise scale (one on which it is
meaningful to say new_value = b*old_value, as with readings of a
thermometer), it is considered an "interval" level variable.  Many
statistical models were originally designed for interval level
variables.  If a measurement is not so precise, but only provides an
ordered categorization of observations, such as "low" "medium" and
"high", it is called an ordinal variable.  If a measurement is
categorical and implies no sense of ordering, such as "European",
"Asian", or "South American", then it is typically called an ordinal
variable.  Assigning the values of "1", "2", and "3" to these
observations has no substantive significance, as we might as well
number them "3","2","1".

Many statistical models are designed for interval level data, but with
appropriate recoding of input, they can also be made to work with
nominal and ordinal data.  In the "old days" of statistical computing,
users were forced to create a lot of indicator (or "dummy") variables,
thereby converting information from nominal or ordinal measurements
into variables that have only values 0 and 1.  For example, to
represent the information about the home continents of survey
respondents, we might create two dummy variables, one for Asia (coded
1 if respondent is from Asia, 0 otherwise) and one for South America
(likewise 0 and 1).  A respondent for whom we find both of these dummy
variables equal to 0 is sure to be from Europe, so we don't usually
need to create three dummy variables.  Doing so would be redundant.

With a modern language like R, much of the drudgery of creating the
indicator variables is handled automatically if the user declares the
variables properly.  In R, and S before it, the term "factor" is used
to refer to a variable that is not measured at the interval level. An
"unordered factor" is a nominal (or categorical) variable, while an
"ordered factor" is the term for an ordinal measurement.  Many
statistical procedures in R have builtin procedures for handling
factors.

Beyond handling coding of noninterval variables, factors play a vital
role in many R procedures.  Procedures can be designed to do a chore
for each value of a factor.  Many procedures will in fact insist that
a variable be designated as a factor.

 ------------------


In this section "Named arguments and defaults", I am left in a
confusion about a few things.  This confusion has bothered me a while.
Can you do more to explain which arguments must be specified, which
are optional, and under what conditions is it necessary to include the
parameter= which calling a function.

1.  When I use a function, and I look in its help page, how do I know
which input variables must be declared and which can be ignored?  This
is quite mysterious.  When invocations leave out some arguments, how
does R "sift through" the ones that are provided to know which is
which?


For example, consider the page on "update.packages".  

Under Usage, I find:
update.packages(lib.loc = .lib.loc, CRAN = getOption("CRAN"),
                contriburl = contrib.url(CRAN),
                method = "auto", instlib = NULL,
                ask=TRUE, available=NULL, destdir=NULL)

I've been using computers a long time, and I use this function every two months or so.  Between times I forget, come back to this page, and still this one leaves me totally confused.  

After fiddling a while, I find this works on Linux:
>update.packages(lib="/usr/lib/R/library",CRAN="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN")

but what bothered me thd most is the "getOption("CRAN") option for CRAN.  I tried many variations on that and never figured how to make it work.


Maybe any clarifications could be related to the section "Getting help with functions and features"

In this section, I think it would be nice to have a paragraph about
"how to read a help page."  Some things are not obvious to all new
users.  Some things in help pages are tough to describe... Maybe I'd
say

How to read a help page.

If you find a help page, notice that it is made up of different parts.

1. "Description". These are usually terse, so read every word
   carefully.

2. Look for the "Value" heading.  That tells you what this procedure is
   going to return when you call it. If this procedure doesn't return
   what you need, you should find out immediately.

3. Under "Usage", most help pages list a number of possible commands
   that can be used.  These are not commands to be typed
   literally. Many of them contain abstract references which provide
   information about the nature of the variables that might be
   entered.  

   Here is a simple case.  The coefficients help page has this:

Usage

coef(object, ...)
coefficients(object, ...)

   Clearly, coef and coefficients are going to do the same thing, and you must supply the appropriate object.

4. Under "Arguments," the help page indicates what inputs this
   procedure wants.  The inputs are described line-by-line, and often
   the comments indicate of parameters are optional or what their
   default value might be.

   Many help pages have the infamous "...", which is something like
   "fill in the appropriately, depending on whatever context you
   find."  In some situations this is easy to understand .  Many help
   pages will eplicitly say that "..." refers to any options that
   might be used with a particular kind of object, and in that case
   one must find the help page for that other object. For example, the
   dev.copy help page clearly indicates that "..." refers to any
   options that might be used with the particular device in question.

   Other help pages are not so informative.  Consider the output from ?coefficients:

Arguments

 object
       an object for which the extraction of model coefficients is meaningful.
 ...
       other arguments.

Here it is clear you need to give a statistical object to have
coefficients removed.  The "..." is a mystery, and most R users will
try to use the coefficients command without worrying about it, and
then backtrack if an error occurs.  And, if an error occurs, there may be no recourse but to read the source code for this command or ask  about it in the r-help email list.

Brian Ripley said that, if I sent these here, they might find their way
to the R-intro team.  So, here is another installment:


Concerning this section:

Data permanency and removing objects.

This is the first place R-intro discusses objects.  I was thinking a
better discussion of objects and syntax is needed, perhaps here, or in
the later section "Objects, their modes and attributes."  I suggest
this:


The fact that R is an object-oriented approach to programming for
statistical analysis has pervasive implications.  If one has studied a
programming language like Java or C++, the notions of object and
method are not new.  For readers who have not studied languages like
that, perhaps we can offer a brief explanation.  An object is a "self
contained data holder" that can follow instructions (do calculations,
provide values).  One intention of this design is to keep things
separate if they belong that way, to reduce the risk that one
calculation accidentally influences the result of another.
Object-orientation also has important implications for the way the
different parts of a program fit together.  Since an object is
supposed to be able to carry out a certain set of actions (which are
called methods, but in R one often says "functions" or "procedures"),
then both the user and the programmer understand what the object can
be expected to do.  There are numerous implications of object
orientation that come into play "under the hood" of the R statistical
engine, but it is not important to delve into them from a user's point
of view.


There is one wrinkle about the syntax of R that we hasten to
emphasize.  In object-oriented computer languages, syntax typically
puts the object first, followed by the instruction, followed any needed
parameters.  In Java, to tell the object "regression" to calculate
estimates for vectors y and x, one would write something like:

   regression.estimate(y,x);

Assuming that object's class has an "estimate" method which knows how
to handle the input, we would be in business.

In R, the syntax is totally different.  Instead of thinking of the
object itself as the primary thing, the syntax in R is designed to use
the method name--the instruction--as the leading concept, and then the
object that is being acted upon is given as a parameter.

When a model gives a result in R, the result is almost invariably an
object, which can then be "poked and prodded" with other methods.
If a linear regression is calculated, for example:

resultObject <- lm(y~x)

the return value is an object.  But, unlike other object-oriented
languages, in R one would write summary(resultObject), or
coefficients(resultObject), rather than the Java style
result_object.summary() or some such thing, in order to investigate the
result.

Bug in persp() bounding box:
If the surface being plotted extends below the lower z-axis boundary, the box
is
drawn with the wrong occlusion. The box is shown as being occluded by the

even though it should be in front of the surface.

The box is correct for surface extending above the box. Problem is only for
surface extending below the box.

This exhibits the bug:

R 1.1.1 on Windows, but I think this is widespread.

Using either

par(cex=0.5)
plot(1:10)
identify(1:10)

or

plot(1:10)
identify(1:10, cex=0.5)

ignores the cex setting.  The root cause is that par(cex=0.5)
alters cexbase for the device but sets cex=1.0, and the internal
text plotting routines use cex and not cexbase.

The obvious fix is to set cex to cexbase in do_identify. However,
if this is fixed, there is another problem, The offset of the label
is related to the cex in use for the label, and not for the symbol.
So

plot(1:10, type="n")
points(1:10, cex=5)
identify(1:10)

is not sensible in placing the labels.  That may be hard to anticipate,
but 

plot(1:10)
identify(1:10, cex=0.5)

needs to use cex=1 not cex=0.5 for the adjustment.  Perhaps identify is
trying too hard, and should give the user more control over the precise
position of the label (as S-PLUS does).

The same with 

 par(cex=1); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World") # OK
 par(cex=2); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World") # OK
 par(cex=2); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World", cex = 1) # NOT OK
 par(cex=2); plot(1:10); text(4, 5, "Hello World", cex = 0.5)

So the scaling with cex in text() is relative to the par() settings,
which is not the expected behaviour.

It is the documented behaviour, though: see the description of cex in
?help.

     cex: numeric character expansion factor; multiplied by
          `par("cex")' yields the final character size.

Subject: strwidth does not take font into account

One for the wishlist.

The text() function permits the use of different fonts with the arguments
"font" or "vfont".  These create text strings of the same height as the
default font, but of different widths: bold face is slightly wider; vector
fonts are usually much wider.  I think the strwidth() function needs to
take the font into account by also having "font" and "vfont" arguments.
Currently it reports the string width using the default font, which can
be quite different.

Here is a little test function you can use to see how far off the
reported string width is.

test.strwidth <-
function(text, vfont=NULL, cex=NULL, ...)
{
 plot(0,0,xlim=c(-1,1),ylim=c(-1,1), type="n")
 text(0,0, text, adj=c(0,0), offset=0, cex=cex, vfont=vfont, ...)
 abline(h=c(0, strheight(text, cex=cex)), lty=2)
 abline(v=c(0, strwidth(text, cex=cex)), lty=2)
}

e.g.

test.strwidth("This is some text", cex=2)
test.strwidth("This is some text", cex=2, font=2)
test.strwidth("This is some text", vfont=c("sans serif", "plain"))

There seems to be a bug in "dotplot" concerning the "cex" parameter. Setting
cex has no effect on the character size of the labels of the points.
This problem was posted to r-help today (Thu, 18 Jan 2001); the solution
given by Brian Ripley (and Uwe Ligges) seems to work for me.

I notices some indesireable behaviour in interaction.plot. The scaling of
the x-axis labels discards the overall settings for the 'cex' attribute,
leading to unscaled labels. The source for this behaviour is the line

mtext(xlabs, 1, at = xvals)

in interaction.plot.

to get this function to perform conform the manual, change this line to

mtext(xlabs, 1, at = xvals, cex=par("cex"))

and all is well.

because of the simplicity of this 'fix' I assume that it is a crossplatform
thingie, but for the record:

I use R-Win in winNT, 1.2.0, upgrading soon.

I'll just end this mail with a standard declaration of love for R

Subject: termplot fails for composite non-factor terms

I am running R 1.2.1 under Windows 98SE.

termplot() currently fails when there are composite terms, thus:
  > library(mass)
  > data(hills)
  > hills.lm <- lm(time ~ climb + poly(dist, 2), data = hills)
  > termplot(hills.lm)
  Hit <Return> to see next plot: 
  Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : Object "dist" not found

The call
  > termplot(hills.lm,data=hills)
does run without generating an error message, i.e. there is a 
problem with the default setting for the parameter 'data'. 
However the x-axis for the term poly(dist,2) is then incorrectly 
labelled as poly(dist,2), rather than dist
The label poly(dist,2) surely belongs as part of the y-axis label.

Here are suggested fixes

1. In the default parameters for the function call change
   data = model.frame(model)
to
   data = get(as.character(model$call$data))

[This does not work if the variable values are specified in the

Also, it does not specify where to get() the data: what environment to
use. The reason that the data= argument is present in termplot() is that
we can't tell where to find the data in general.

The situation is better as of R1.2, since we can look up variables in the
environment of the model formula. This would fix not only termplot() but a
number of other prediction-related problems.

This looks like a good idea.

Hi.  Let's try to explain the subject line with some code:

> split.screen (c(2,1))
[1] 1 2
> screen(1)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, log="y", main="1")
> screen (2)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, main="2")
> screen (1)
Error in par(.split.screens[[n]]) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter "yaxp".
> close.screen(all=TRUE)

Let's add comments:

> split.screen (c(2,1))
[1] 1 2

OK, plot in the top half screen:
> screen(1)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, log="y", main="1")
> par("yaxp")
[1]  1  2 -5

OK, switch to bottom half:
> screen (2)
> plot (1:2, 1:2, main="2")
> par("yaxp")
[1] 1 2 5

OK, looks fine, let's go back up:
> screen (1)
Error in par(.split.screens[[n]]) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter "yaxp".

Bummer.
> close.screen(all=TRUE)

Somehow I'm hoping you'll tell me I'm doing something wrong, because
I'd really would like to be able to do the following:
  repeat {
    #calculate
    screen(1)
    #fancy plot
    screen (2)
    #even fancier plot ;-)
    if (user.bored()) break
  }
Which is roughly what I was doing when the error messages started
popping up.

Thanks,
  -tom

[I have abbreviated the subject as jitterbug has been having probems
with long subjects.]

The issue here is that one cannot mix log/non-log axes in the calls to
screen(), as the appropriate par() parameter is read-only, but the
meaning of yaxp depends on it.  But beyond that you can't set
x/yaxp for log axes.

You should be able to do this: you can in the S original.

A simpler version:

plot (1:2, 1:2, log="y", main="1")
zz <- par("yaxp")
zz
[1]  1  2 -5
par(yaxp=zz)
Error in par(yaxp = zz) : invalid value specified for graphics parameter
"yaxp".

So you can't reset the yaxp parameter to what it is reported as!


Additional bug: the meaning of x/yaxp for log axes is not defined
in help(par).

[snip]

The code in main/par.c ignores the value of xlog (or ylog) when
setting xaxp (or yaxp).  Right now you have in Specify (and Specify2):

... else if (streql(what, "xaxp")) {
	value = coerceVector(value, REALSXP);
	lengthCheck(what, value, 3);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[0], what);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[1], what);
        posIntCheck((int) (REAL(value)[2]), what);

Shouldn't that be something like:

... else if (streql(what, "xaxp")) {
	value = coerceVector(value, REALSXP);
	lengthCheck(what, value, 3);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[0], what);
	naRealCheck(REAL(value)[1], what);
        if (dd->gp.xlog)
            logAxpCheck((int) (REAL(value)[2]), what);
        else
            posIntCheck((int) (REAL(value)[2]), what);

Where logAxpCheck is suitably defined as:

static void logAxpCheck(int x, char *s)
{
    if (x == NA_INTEGER || x == 0 || x > 4)
	par_error(s);
}

since only values < 0 or the values 1, 2, 3 are allowed?


> Additional bug: the meaning of x/yaxp for log axes is not defined
> in help(par).

excerpt from help(par):

    xaxp: A vector of the form `c(x1, x2, n)' giving the coordinates
          of the extreme tick marks and the number of intervals
          between tick-marks.

Could you add:

          The value of n must be positive for linear scale axes.  For
          logarithmic scale axes n must be either negative (then there
          will be (1-n) ticks at a linear distance) or one of 1, 2, or
          3 where n then indicates the number of ticks per decade.

similar for yaxp?  What am I missing?

Hi.  As far as I understand it, there is a list of graphic primitives
stored for a device.  So for example, when I iconify/deiconify an X11
window, the plot will be redrawn.  Now screen (split.screen and
friends) appear not to handle this list properly, the list is reset or
not reset at odd times.  The commands below will show clearly what I
mean.  There are two effects:

  - After splitting the device real estate into two screens, I can
    plot on these screens, alternating between them.  When I then
    touch the window to force a redraw, *all* the plots are redrawn,
    not just the last (and visible) ones.
    [This happens when the X server runs on AIX, R runs on AIX or Sun.]

  - Again, after splitting, plotting on one screen can affect the
    other screen.  I.e. plot(...); plot (...) on the left screen can
    erase the *right* screen.
    [This happens for all platforms I have access to, AIX, Linux, Sun.]

The first effect may be due to a bad interaction with the X server,
but the second effect is surely not desirable, is it?  Am I mis-using
'screen' here?

Giving an adj argument to axis() seems to have no effect.  In Splus, adj = 0 
left-justifies the labels under the ticks, adj = 1 right justifies them, and 
numbers in between can also be used.  I like to use adj = 0.9 to get something
that looks like this:

-----------+-----------+-----------+------------+---------
        1980        1981        1982         1983

as an axis for a plot of monthly time series data.

Subject:  par(mgp) bug 

Hi

The behaviour of the third argument of par(mgp), which controls the
placement of the axis ticks, is not working.  

In the following example, the plots should NOT be
identical; the axis ticks plus the axis major line should be drawn one
line out from the edges of the plot region.

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(1:10)
par(mgp=c(3,1,1))
plot(1:10)

This is more of an incompatibility-with-S rather than a bug.  In R,
axis(pos=) overrides axis(line=) which overrides par(mgp=).  It is possible
to get axis to respond to par(mgp=), but this is NOT the default behaviour.
For example,

par(mgp=c(3, 1, 1))
plot(1:10, axes=F)
box()
axis(1, line=NA)
axis(2)

In S, par(mgp=) specifies locations RELATIVE TO axis(line=), which can be
overridden by axis(pos=).

So the options are:
(i) become compatible NOW (for 1.3)
(ii) become compatible later
(iii) remain incompatible

I think we should do (i), especially because the default behaviour, which I
think would cover 99.999% of user code, would NOT change.

This is your chance to disagree ...

Hi

Bug summary:----
par(xpd=T)
plot(0:1, 0:1)
legend(x=0, y=1.2, pch=c(1,2), legend=c("May","June"))

the first plot character is omitted when plotting to
the screen.
Bug summary:----

I cannot reproduce this bug, BUT it did show up a bug in rect() -- in the
example above, the border around the legend is not drawn.

This is because rect() ignores par(xpd).  The default is rect(xpd=FALSE).  This
is at odds with text(xpd=NULL) and polygon(xpd=NULL) which use par(xpd) by
default.  arrows(xpd=FALSE) has the same problem as rect().  

I propose modifying rect() and arrows() to use par(xpd) by default like text()
and polygon().  There will, as usual, be a small risk that someone's code will
produce different output after this change, but this risk should be pretty
small.

Any objections ... ?

Paul

Hi

Bug summary:----
par(xpd=T)
plot(0:1, 0:1)
legend(x=0, y=1.2, pch=c(1,2), legend=c("May","June"))

the first plot character is omitted when plotting to
the screen.
Bug summary:----

I cannot reproduce this bug, BUT it did show up a bug in rect() -- in the
example above, the border around the legend is not drawn.

This is because rect() ignores par(xpd).  The default is rect(xpd=FALSE).  This
is at odds with text(xpd=NULL) and polygon(xpd=NULL) which use par(xpd) by
default.  arrows(xpd=FALSE) has the same problem as rect().  

I propose modifying rect() and arrows() to use par(xpd) by default like text()
and polygon().  There will, as usual, be a small risk that someone's code will
produce different output after this change, but this risk should be pretty
small.

Any objections ... ?

Paul

Coincidence, I *did* look at that bug only yesterday.
My experience:
   I *could* reproduce the bug {X11(), Linux-386}, but only a few times. 
   Then, it didn't show anymore. Even restarting R wouldn't show it again.
   My ``explanation'' was that it might be (a bug) inside X11 / Window manager
   handling of things... ??

not at all, but please fix  abline(*) at the same time.
It doesn't obey xpd either (PR#750).

Both of these changes made now (for 1.3.1).  
The following code should demonstrate the bugs (in pre-1.3.1 R) and the fixes:

par(mfrow=c(2,1), xpd=FALSE)
plot(1:10)
plot(1:10)
# rect() and arrow() ignored par(xpd=)
rect(1, 9, 2, 20, col="red")

This is related to bug #865, which I have discovered is a problem with some
of the very basic transformation code in R graphics (for transforming widths
or heights when there are log scales).  I have a fix for this particular
mtext() problem, but I'm still working on the more general transformation
bug.

This is now fixed (which also fixes PR#865).
Also fixed for mtext() when side=1, log="x", and las=2 (and for corresponding
siutations on sides 3 and 4).
Also fixed for mtext() when text is an expression (i.e., mathematical
annotation).

Unfortunately, the problem goes pretty deep -- it is to do with transformation
of widths and heights to or from USER coordinates when the axis is logged. 
There are a couple of other places where this causes a problem:
(i) strwidth() and strheight() 
(ii) symbols()

I'm leaving this bug active until these other issues are resolved.

Try this

example(palette)

then trigger a redraw e.g. by resizing the window. Shouldn't the
palette be stored as part of the display list?

(This only happens because the palette was reset at the end of the
example, but still...)

I could argue either way on this.

I agree that its nasty to have plot colours change in mid-stream,
but I suspect that adding the palette to the display list may not
be the "right" solution.

A different approach would be to map the colour indices (and names)
to RGB values at a slightly higher level.  That way it would be the
RGB values which would be captured in the display list, not the
indices.

[ I'm afraid that I think that the whole display list mechanism is
  "wrong".  We need a much higher level way of describing plots. ]

Hi,

This email reports bugs in acinclude.m4, src/library/tcltk/src/Makefile,
and share/perl/Rd2contents.pl.  It is based on R-patched.tgz from 07/27/2001
(R 1.3.0) and comes from trying to compile R on AIX 4.3.

1) acinclude.m4:  A string on line 3096 starts with a single quote: ' but
is terminated with a double quote: ".  (This leads to the weird error
message that configure can't execute 'shared' on line 4060.)
     The fix is simply to use single quotes both times:
allow_undefined_flag='${wl}-berok'

2) after configure (with CC=gcc but using AIX's linker /usr/bin/ld), the
Makefile in src/library/tcltk/src doesn't protect the linker flags -bI
with -Xlinker! (-Xlinker is required when using gcc so that the linker flags
are passed on to ld correctly.  Which I know that you know...)
  The fix is to add -Xlinker before every -bI. Sorry, haven't looked into
patching configure yet...

3) Rd2contents.pl:  this perl script fails in the base library!  There are
too many files in the man directory and perl reports 'glob failed'.  When I
try 'ls man/*.Rd'  bash also reports that the argument list is too long.  I
don't know whether this limitation comes from AIX, bash or perl and why it
doesn't happen with, say, Linux.
The fix is to replace the simple while loop (line 6):
  while(<$ARGV[0]/man/*.Rd>){ &do_one; }

with a loop over the contents of the directory using readdir:

if (opendir RD, "$ARGV[0]/man") {
    my $f;
    while (defined ($f = readdir RD)) {
     $_ = "$ARGV[0]/man/$f", &do_one if $f =~ m,.Rd$,;
    }
    closedir RD;
}

A) tkConfig.sh contains a line like this:
   TK_XINCLUDES='# no special path needed'
This has nothing to do with R proper but this bug which is either in AIX or
the local installation of X shows up during the compilation of R.  Anyhow,
this line is plain stupid since when passed on to the compiler _comments
out_ the rest of the line!  (Think about:
  gcc fine_program.c #no special path needed -lX11 -Xm
)  The fix is to use "TK_XINCLUDES=''" in tkConfig.sh
Again, I know this is not a problem with R but I'm adding it here for people
to find if they use the mailing list archive.

After these changes R compiles (producing warnings about duplicate
symbols...) and installs.  'make check' fails in mva--report to follow.

Regards,
  -tom

Would that be 2001-07-27?  Not all of us live in countries that flout ISO
standards!

That is a generated file.  It coems from m4/libtool.m4.

(! That looks like a bash bug.  Your bash version is ?  sh is supposed ot
have no line length limits.)

Do you have a current perl?  Globbing was changed in 5.6.0 to be handled
in C code, as I recall.  It does not happen on Solaris, Linux or Windows,
and I suspect a perl upgrade might fix it.  Try 5.6.1, if you are not
already using it.

(slower and less portable if it is not needed.)

Your perl version is ?

Oops.  Should have used the contents of the date stamp file...

...which means I should have said...
 Line 1473 in m4/libtool.m4 contains the unterminated string.

Hmm, should the name of the file suggest to me that it's part of some
other package, like 'libtool', and I should file a bug report with
it's maintainer?

Guilty as suspected.  My bash and perl is rather old...

I'm not and I won't.  I'll live with my old perl since I don't want to
download and compile perl and bash...  I have a work around and if the
installation fails for somebody else they might have a hack available
when they search the r-bugs/r-devel archive.  Should I encounter the
problem again with a current installation (on a different system),
I'll let you know, otherwise I'll shut up.

True (especially the portability argument) if globbing is handled in
C in Perl nowadays.  I'd challenge the "slower" if Perl had to use the
shell since the shell would sort the file list which readdir won't.
 
> Your perl version is ?

Too embarassed to tell ;-)  Mea culpa, I'll bring up Perl issues in
the future only when I know I have a recent version...

Fixed now.  The file comes from libtool 1.4.  Unfortunately, we have to
patch it ourselves, as the libtool 1.4 `patch release' suddenly requires
autoconf 2.50 ...

Very strange.  Configure has

  *aix4.[2-9]*)
    EXPORTFILE="\$(top_builddir)/etc/R.exp"
    cpicflags=
    cxxpicflags=
    fpicflags=
    wl="-Wl,"
    main_ldflags="${wl}-bdynamic ${wl}-bE:${EXPORTFILE} ${wl}-bM:SRE"
    shlib_ldflags="${wl}-bM:SRE ${wl}-H512 ${wl}-T512 ${wl}-bnoentry \
      ${wl}-bexpall ${wl}-bI:\$(R_HOME)/etc/R.exp"
    SHLIB_LIBADD="\$(LIBM)"
    ;;

so unless I am missing something obvious all linker flages are protected
via `-Wl,' (which should also work if the C compiler is not gcc).

Sorry, should have been more explicit, I guess: the problem is with
PKG_LIBS (which is the only variable in that Makefile using linker
flags...)  Some digging shows that '-Wl,' (or '-Xlinker') is missing
in tkConfig.sh.  So if you have Tcl/Tk (8.3 in my case) installed and
used AIX's 'cc' compiler, you get in trouble with later using gcc
(e.g. for R).  Oddly, this didn't show when compiling, say, Tktable.

There is the question, why configure didn't "see" this coming.  What
would be nice is a warning to the effect that tkConfig.sh is broken
when R can't compile tcltk.c.  (Currently I get messages about libc.a
not found...)

Thanks,
  -tom

I've just installed R 1.3.0, and everything went fine except that
the resulting directories and files were owned by root, and for ordinary
users there was no access for most of them. This was also the case with
a large amount of files. I've fixed the installation manually, but it
took quite a lot of time.

Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


I reported this on r-help, but here is official bug report.

The present convolve() does not do convolution by default. Its default behaviour
is
correlation. This is a bug.

The default argument conj should be set to FALSE.

The zero-padding should be on the right for linear convolution (don't ask me
why you call this type="open"; I suggest type="linear").

Here is what I expect linear convolution to do:
myconvolve<-function (x,h) 
{
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    #zero pad
    if(nx>nh)
       {
       x <- c(x,rep(0, nh-1))
       h<-c(h,rep(0,nx-1))
       }
    else
       {
       h <- c(h,rep(0, nx-1))
       x<-c(x,rep(0,nh-1))
       }
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/length(x)
#I am not sure about this, the R IFFT is weird
}

What "circular" convolution should do is just
eliminate the zero-padding:

myconvolve2<-function (x,h)
{
#no padding, circular convolution
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/(nx)
}


I suggest that you create two functions, convolve() and correlate(), and get
rid
of the conj argument in convolve().

Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

...but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

Reply-To: Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

This is not only bug report, but also a RFC (request for comments):

The basic problem is that there are (at least) two ways of easily getting
non-factor character columns in data.frames.
The first is  
    read.table(*, as.is = TRUE) 
and the second is
    data.frame(.., I(...), ..)	      

which differ in their result. Whereas the first produces `pure' character
columns in the data.frame, the second approach gives `AsIs' classed
columns (character, or, e.g. logical).

Now, as the following shows,  rbind.data.frame()  *is* buggy anyway,
I wonder if we shouldn't change read.table(*, as.is = TRUE)
such that the non-numeric columns of its result become "AsIs" classed as
well:

-----------

str(d1 <- data.frame(a=1:3, b = I(letters[1:3])))
## d1 is `alright'
## d0: The same but a `character' *not* protected by AsIs:
d0 <- d1
d0$b <- unclass(d0$b)
str(d0)
## Note that this is *really* the same as a what you get from
##  read.table(*, as.is = TRUE)
##  ----------
##  R's read.table() is S+ compatible; however I wonder if
##  we shouldn't add  "AsIs" classes to all non-numeric components...
##  the classes, shouldn't harm, but ensure consistency of treatment..

str(d11 <- rbind(d1, new = c(7, "N"))) ## alright
str(d01 <- rbind(d0, new = c(7, "N"))) ## all wrong :
## Both columns were coerced to factors !!
##-- S-PLUS 5 coerces both to "character" -- which is better,
##  since the new row *is* all character

## R makes nonsense with 'b' [factor w/ 1 level "N": NA NA NA 1]
## S+ 5.1 does exactly the right thing [both a & b still look like in d0,d1 :
str(d12 <- rbind(d1, new = data.frame(a= 7, b="N")))##
str(d02 <- rbind(d0, new = data.frame(a= 7, b="N")))##

Subject:  Managed to confuse match.arg 

This one may not strictly be a bug, and it was certainly my
fault, but it took me a while to track it down and it is rather
strange:

funOne <- function(x)
{
  funTwo <- 1:10
  funTwo(x)
}

funTwo <- function(v) 2*v

funOne(5) # answer is 10 as expected

# now a different definition for funTwo with a match.arg

funTwo <- function(v, foo=c("small", "large"))
{
  foo <- match.arg(foo)
  print(foo)
  2*v
}

funOne(5) # answer is 10, but foo is NULL

What happens is that in funOne I mask funTwo with a vector, but
that doesn't matter as the call to funTwo specifies
mode="function" (or something similar).  But what happens when
funTwo includes a match.arg?  In this case match.arg fails, and
the reason it fails is that sys.function(sys.parent()) in
match.arg evaluates to 1:10.  If there is a bug here it is the
failure of sys.function to grab a function, with the result that
formal.args in match.fun is NULL.

Cheers, Jonathan.

[sys.function fails sometimes (sorry, our mail system decide to throw
away the original mail)]

Yes, I bumped into something similar recently. The problem is that we
only actually store the call in the context structure, not the
function, so sys.function has to grab the call, take the 1st element,
and reevaluate it in the parent frame. It is quite easy to think up
examples where a second evaluation does not give the same value as
the first. 

Your particular case is of a slightly different natur and should be
easily fixable by replacing findVar in R_sysfunction by findVar1 and
looking specifically for objects of mode "function", but the basic
problem persists. I don't think I want to risk fixing this (and maybe
unfixing something else) for 1.2.3 tomorrow though.

Subject:  Inconsistent behaviour of is.vector? 
Cc: dma0jcr@modigliani.dur.ac.uk
X-ECS-MailScanner: Found to be clean

Hi everyone,

I have noticed that is.vector returns FALSE if I attach
attributes:

> x <- c(a = 1, b = 2)
> attributes(x)
$names
[1] "a" "b"

> is.vector(x)
[1] TRUE
> attr(x, "fred") <- "happy"
> attributes(x)
$names
[1] "a" "b"

$fred
[1] "happy"

> is.vector(x)
[1] FALSE

This seems inconsistent to me, as "names" is itself an attribute
yet this does negate is.vector.  As the original x is clearly a
vector, albeit one with names, wouldn't it be consistent to allow
any attributes?  This appears to be the case for is.matrix ...

> x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2)
> is.matrix(x)
[1] TRUE
> attributes(x)
$dim
[1] 2 2
> attr(x, "fred") <- "happy"
> x
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
attr(,"fred")
[1] "happy"
> is.matrix(x)
[1] TRUE

Cheers, Jonathan.

This seems intentional.  as.vector(x) changes x, and is.vector should be a
test of no change.  It is in S:

From S-PLUS 3.4:

       is.vector returns TRUE if x is a simple object of the mode
       specified, and FALSE otherwise.  If the mode is "any", any
       simple object will match,  that  is,  an  object  with  no
       attributes.   Note  that  a  list is typically a vector in
       this sense.

Note the `simple' in there.

R appears to allow names as attributes but nothing else, but does not
document this (except in the source code).  Anyone want to explain why R
is incompatible with S?  And why as.vector and is.vector are inconsistent?
(Note that the isas tests do not pick this up.)

This is a documentation bug, at least.

Well, dim is an attribute, so you want an array to be a vector?

Under R 1.3.0 on Solaris and Windows NT  there seems to be a bug in == when
applied to elements of a list, particularly when one of the elements is of
mode integer:

	> list(1) == list(1)
	[1] FALSE
	> 1 == list(1)
	[1] TRUE
	> as.integer(1)==list(as.integer(1))
	[1] FALSE
	> as.integer(1)==list(as.double(1))
	[1] FALSE
	> list(as.integer(1))==list(as.integer(1))
	[1] FALSE
	> list(as.integer(1))==as.integer(1)
	[1] FALSE
	> list(as.double(1))==list(as.double(1))
	[1] FALSE

However, these cases work:

	> as.double(1)==list(as.integer(1))
	[1] TRUE
	> list(as.integer(1))==as.double(1)
	[1] TRUE

Replacing the bare integer/double with a vector constructed with c() doesn't
change the results, and comparing between vectors created with c() appears
correct.

It is not entirely clear what we *should* be doing here. S (-PLUS 3.4)
is at least consistent:

> list(1) == list(1)
Error in list(1) == list(1): == operation on mode "list" undefined
Dumped
>  1 == list(1)
Error in 1 == list(1): == operation on mode "list" undefined
Dumped
> as.integer(1)==list(as.integer(1))
Error in as.integer(1) == list(as.integer(1)): == operation on mode "list"
        undefined
Dumped
...

so one might argue that you shouldn't do that in the first place...
(or that the bug is that we do not expressly forbid doing this.)

As of 1.4, we will have the `identical' function, which is the right way
to do such comparisons in any case.

So I'd vote for making a use of the comparison operators an error unless
the type is correct (or there is a method defined).  There is even code
in relop.c (commented out) that looks like the right test.  Any
objections?

Not really, except that I get the usual nagging suspicion that someone
(who?) meant something by doing it this way...

The current logic seems to be that if either side of the == is a
vector of atomic type, try to coerce the list on the other side to a
similar object and then test. However this has a clear bug in that the
coercion is to double even when the atomic vector is integer. If there
are lists on both sides, a pointer comparison is done:

> x<-2
> list(x)==list(x)
[1] FALSE
> list(.Alias(x))==list(.Alias(x))
[1] TRUE

The latter seems highly dubious to me. I'd rather have a recursive
pairwise application of "==" there. However, none of this is what
identical does, is it?

And the bug is?

The generic indexing should really be x[...,drop=T].  Methods for
specific classes can specialize to a particular number of indices if
they want to, which is what is happening here

> get ("[.data.frame")
function (x, i, j, drop = if (missing(i)) TRUE else length(cols) == 
    1) 

one could fairly easily slip in a "..." argument after "j", and then
inside the function give an error if "..." is not empty, but what
would the point be?

The point would be to catch errors like this

for ( i in 1:2 ) foo[i,2] <- my.fun( bar[,i,2] , another.arg )

that might otherwise pass unnoticed when 'bar' is a data.frame.

The problem is that SleepHandler is not removed if the sleep is
interrupted. The segfault occurs if Sys.sleep() called again, or as soon
as the timer runs out.

It looks as though either do_syssleep needs to handle SIGINT itself or
jump_to_toplevel needs to know about event handlers.

I'm surprised we don't get more of these sorts of things on UNIX.  Our
current UNIX interrupt handling approach takes an immediate LONGJMP
out of the signal handler no matter where the signal occurs (except
for two places where signals are suspended).  Any place where an
invariant is temporarily broken, any place where an assignment is not
yet complete, is a potential trouble spot.

I've been meaning to raise this issue at some point: I think we will
need to eventually spend some time re-examining how we want to handle
interrupts.  Right now on Windows/Mac interrupts are only processed at
special points in the evaluation process, which is a bit restrictive
(but perhaps unavoidable due to OS limitations).  On UNIX on the other
hand we LONGJUMP out of the signal handler except for the very few
places where the signal gets masked temporarily (GC and one place in
graphics I believe).  The UNIX approach is much too loose even now,
and it becomes even more untenable if we add any kind of threading
support.

We will I think have to come up with a cleaner model for very
selectively enabling interrupt processing, perhaps with some
integration with the external function registration mechanism Duncan
added recently (e.g. marking a function as one where LONGJMP's are
safe).  We will also need some means of controlling interrupt
behaviour from R, such as having some sort of without.interrupts and
with.interrupts functions to be able to program reliable interaction
with interrupts at the R level. (Another sort of thing we might
consider is suspending interrupts during on.exit processing.)

It's a farily big can of worms, and probably not urgent for now, but
we will need to look at it eventually.

FWIW, Octave doesn't do this correctly either, it just does a longjmp,
same as R, which can result in leaking memory, and possibly other bad
things.

The way Bash handles this is to only set a flag in the handler for
SIGINT, then at safe places in the code, there are

  QUIT;

statements.  These are macros that expand to some code that may
longjump somewhere depending on the interrupt state.  This method
avoids the problems of jumping out of the signal handler, which may
result in memory leaks or inconsistencies in global state.  The hard
part is inserting the (many!) QUIT statements, though it is probably
somewhat easier if this type of choice is made early on in the life of
the program instead of late.

I only mention Bash because it is a program that is expected to
handle a lot of interrupts without leaking memory or crashing, and
seems to do so reasonably well.

Packages like R and Octave also have to be able to handle interrupts
in calls Fortran or C code that may run for a long time, and which
cannot be modified (at least not easily) to add the equivalent QUIT
calls.  I'm not sure what the right solution is for cases like that.

(R-1.3.0 on linux, alpha and intel; also tested on R-1.1.1 on irix.)

Below is a program that creates some random data (n, x, and y), creates a
factor out of x and y and then creates a factor z out of their interaction
(corresponding, with the default nf = 2, to quadrants, which is how I came
upon this).  It then runs an analysis of variance.

f.test.problem <- 
function(n = 100, nf = 2){

  t1 <- data.frame(n = rnorm(n), x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))

  t1$x <- cut(t1$x, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$y <- cut(t1$y, nf, labels = 1:nf)
  t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = F)
  
  print(table(t1$x))
  print(table(t1$y))
  print(table(t1$z))
  
  summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
}

Here's the problem:  if none of the nf * nf levels of z is empty -- that
is, if there is at least one trial taking on each value -- I get the error
"Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type".

traceback() gives:

8: model.matrix.default(mt, mf, contrasts)
7: model.matrix(mt, mf, contrasts)
6: lm(formula = n ~ z, data = t1, singular.ok = TRUE)
5: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
4: eval(lmcall, parent.frame())
3: aov(n ~ z, data = t1)
2: summary(aov(n ~ z, data = t1))
1: f.test.problem(nf = 3)


However, if one of the levels of z is empty (which I'm checking using
table), then the analysis of variance runs!  (Easy to see if you use nf =
4 or even 3; it won't take long to get some examples that run and some
that don't.)

Creating n and z outside of a dataframe and then running aov(n~z) doesn't
help.

The problem does not arise if I do aov(n ~ x, data = t1) or 
aov(n ~ y, data = t1) -- the analysis of variance runs whether there are
empty categories or not.


Finally:  if I specify drop = T in the interaction call:
t1$z <- interaction(t1$x, t1$y, drop = T)
then the analysis works whether a factor actually gets dropped or
not.  That is, even when no factor is empty (and so I got an error with
drop = F), everything works.

So the problem seems to arise from something going on in interaction.  I'm
not sure what, and I'm sure someone else will see the problem faster than
I will.

Apologies in advance if I'm being dense and this is really how things
ought to work.  If not, I'll submit a formal bug report.

Hi, there are two problems in devX11.c.  The one is an undocumented
nuisance and the other isn't a bug until you try to embed an X11
device in another window (think tktoplevel() in tcltk package...).

Let's take a look at locator() first: Assuming you call locator() with
a current X11 device, this call is handled in X11_Locator
(src/unix/X11/devX11.c).  When you have one window open and call
locator, you have three options to quit the locator: click Button 1
(to locate), click Button 2 (to abort), or destroy the window.  The
later results in the error message: "Error in locator(1) : No graphics
device is active". That's OK, sort of.

This gets problematic when you open two windows:
> x11()  # assume that's device 2
> x11()  # assume that's device 3
> plot(1)
> locator(1)  # with device 3 == dev.cur()!

When you now destroy device 3 (where locator expects the click), you have
*no alternative but to close _all_ windows* to abort the locator.  The
locator continues to wait for mouse clicks in device 3 where of course
no further clicks can come from.  That's the nuisance part.

The second problem is that the device may try to plot() into a
non-existant window.  Assume that the window was destroyed by some
other part of the program.  The device (at some point in the future)
will receive a DestroyNotify event that handleEvent ignores.
Blissfully!  *No KillDevice is called* when the window is destroyed by
something other than the WM_DELETE_WINDOW mechanism!  This happens
when you embed the X11 device into another window/application.  For
starters, the device no longer receives WM_DELETE_WINDOW client
messages.  But it does receive a DestroyNotify event when the parent
(the container window) is destroyed.  HandleEvent should, well
_handle_ this _event_.

The patch below is a _suggestion_ how to solve both problems.  It is
against the current r-devel, 1.3, as of 2/13.  I believe this behavior
exists in version 1.2 as well and can be solved there the same way.
The patch is just meant as a convenient and concise way to describe
my suggestion.  I'd greatly appreciate feedback or other ideas!

Implementation:

-- the variable inclose is now in the device specific structure (why
   was it global?)  After the window is mapped, inclose is TRUE until
   the window is destroyed explicitly or a DestroyNotify event has been
   received.
-- the deviceSpecific pointer is set to NULL after the memory has been
   freed. This (side?) effect is used in X11_Locator to detect the
   closing of the current device  which _must_ lead to an error.
-- the if statement to handle events of type DestroyEvent is added to 
   handleEvent
-- when the user closes the device (dev.off()), the window is
   destroyed in X11_Close
-- when the user pushes the close button in the window frame, the
   window is destroyed in handleEvent and X11_Close is initiated
   (the WM_DELETE_WINDOW mechanism already in place.)
-- when the window is destroyed for another reason (e.g. the parent
   being destroyed), it is not destroyed again but X11_Close is still
   initiated.

Regards,
  -tom

Heh. Quite probably, this is also the source of the FVWM trouble
reported earlier although that triggered an infinite loop which should
probably be guarded against by other means as well. 

Thanks for filing this (good to have as bug report so that we don't
forget - it's the sort of thing that often has to wait until someone
has a clear enough mind and sufficient stamina to try and get it
right.)

Subject: R-1.2.3 OSF precompiled binary doesn't run under DU4.0D

Full_Name: Paul Mather
Version: 1.2.3
OS: Digital Unix 4.0D
Submission from: (NULL) (128.173.35.237)


The precompiled binary for "osf4.0" distributed via CRAN does not run under
Digital Unix 4.0.  The error given is:

Fatal error: The X11 shared library could not be loaded.
  The error was dlopen: cannot load /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R_X11.so

Subsequent investigation actually reveals that the R_X11.so was linked against
libdnet.so, which is not present on standard Digital Unix 4.0D systems.  The
error is triggered by an inability to load the libdnet.so shared library.

As I understand it, libdnet provides DECnet support.  Digital Unix 4.0D systems
ship with libdnet_stub.so, which is a library of empty stub functions.

Is it possible to provide a version of R_X11.so linked against libdnet_stub.so?
Aside from this problem, the precompiled binary appears to work (i.e.,
"R -g none" runs).

Cheers,

Paul.

R-1.3.0 was built on Irix 6.5 using gcc and MIPSPro f90.  This combination has
worked for previous versions, in particular R-1.2.3.

$ cd test/Examples
$ ../../bin/R --vanilla < modreg-Ex.R > modreg-Ex.Rout

This worked in R-1.2.3.  It looks like there were a number 
of cosmetic changes to the modreg Fortran sources since R-1.2.3. 
SGI MIPSPro f90 was used to compile modreg, e.g.:

   f90 -OPT:IEEE_NaN_inf=ON -KPIC -O2 -c sslvrg.f -o sslvrg.o

We had a private report of this on Iris 6.5, and the resolution was that it
worked with optimization off.

This is the only platform reporting a problem, so we need someone to debug
it there.

I have a R function which call a C function by the instruction ".Call".
The first time I call the R function in a R session, it perfectly runs. But the
next 
times, R returns this error message :

Error in .Call("", bankpath, accn, indexpath, key, beg, end) :
        .Call function name not in load table

The function name has disappeared !!
This function well runs on Mandrake 7.2 but not in Mandrake 8.0. Why ?!?

Thanks for your answers...
PS : Excuse my poor english...

Hi Ludovic.

 There are at least two possible explanations for this behaviour.

  1)  There is a bug in the recently changed code in R to find 
     routines in C and Fortran libraries.

  2)  The routine that you are .Call()'ing is doing something
  that has confused the R internals and makes the next R commands
  not work, and potentially this is not reproducible.

If this is not proprietary or confidential code, you can send the C
code and instructions as to how to call it from R (that is, provide
simple values for the bankpath, accn, indexpath, key, beg and end
arguments), then I can see if the computations are potentially
writing over other values in memory.

Also, you can try a invoking a very simple .Call() routine 
many times to see if that displays the same failure. For example,
put the following C code in a file named simpleCall.c

#include "Rinternals.h"

SEXP
simpleCall() 
{
  static int count = 0;
  SEXP ans;

  PROTECT(ans = allocVector(INTSXP, 1));
  INTEGER(ans)[0] = count++;

  UNPROTECT(1);
  return(ans);
}

Then, compile this with 
  R CMD SHLIB simpleCall.c

and call it from R in the following way

 > dyn.load("simpleCall.so")
 > for(i in 1:10) { print(.Call("simpleCall")) }

If this works, it won't determine whether it is 1) or 2) (or any other
possible reason), but if it doesn't work, we will have a lot more
information.

 Thanks,
   Duncan

Hello,


During the 'make check' step of the installation procedure, I had the following
error messages


> make test > rapportMakeTest
/bin/sh: /usr/local/bin//perl: arg list too long

----------
I've seen that already in my former life in the software industry.
It seems the SGI sh shell is rather more limitated by the length
of arg lists than it's linux conterpart (I do not know about the other OSs).

----------
>gmake[3]: *** [modreg-Ex.Rout] Bus error (core dumped)

----------
I cannot (or rather I do not dare) make any hypothesis about this one...

system.file("",package") is documented to return the root of the package
(as it did in the past). It actually returns "" (Win98, R1.3.0), breaking
the SJava package

Omitting the first argument does work correctly and so is a workaround if
the argument is explicitly "" but not if it is the value of a variable.

Thomas,

I think you are misreading the docs: we have

     system.file(..., package = "base", lib.loc = .lib.loc, pkg, lib)

so the package argument must be named.

I think you were caught by

	R> system.file("", "eda")
	[1] ""

but you need to do

	R> system.file("", package = "eda")
	[1] "/usr/local/lib/R/library/eda/"

My Unix systems give results like

> system.file("", package="eda")
[1] "/ext/R/1.3.0/lib/R/library/eda/"
> system.file("",package="Rstreams")
[1] "/ext/R/library/Rstreams/"

under 1.3.0.  It's the trailing slash that is the problem, and which is not
as documented in the Value section. That is not a file under Windows, and
so file.exists() fails.  (That suprised me a bit, but one could argue it is
not actually a file under Unix either: the directory file is
/ext/R/1.3.0/lib/R/library/eda and that does work.)

Rather than special-case system.file("",package), I think we should remove
the `or \code{""}' from the documentation.


(The problem with SJava on Windows is one of several I reported to DTL on
Mon Jul 16.)

Yes. I didn't think so initially, but on reflection
  system.file(some.file,package="blah")
probably should return "" if some.file happens to be "" or have length 0.

Hi,

I installed R 1.3.1 on HP-UX. This caused me quite some
problems. These problems did not occur with the previous version
I installed, which was R version 1.2.3.

First, the result of configure:

    R is now configured for hppa-hp-hpux10.20

      Source directory:          .
      Installation directory:    /opt_local/opt/R
      C compiler:                cc  -D_HPUX_SOURCE +DA1.1 +DS1.1 -Wp,-H16000 -I/opt_local/opt/readline/include -I/opt_local/opt/tk/include -I/opt_local/opt/tcl/include -I/opt_local/opt/jpeg6/include -I/opt_local/opt/png/include -I/opt_local/opt/ncurses/include -I/opt_local/opt/zlib/include -I/users1/kleiweg/R-1.3.1-source -L/opt_local/opt/readline/lib -L/opt_local/opt/tk/lib -L/opt_local/opt/tcl/lib -L/opt_local/opt/jpeg6/lib -L/opt_local/opt/png/lib -L/opt_local/opt/ncurses/lib -L/opt_local/opt/zlib/lib -L/users1/kleiweg/R-1.3.1-source -Aa
      C++ compiler:              c++  -g -O2
      FORTRAN compiler:          fort77  +DA1.1 +DS1.1

      X11 support:               yes
      Gnome support:             no
      Tcl/Tk support:            yes

      R profiling support:       yes
      R as a shared library:     no

The first make halts on src/main/Rdynload.c, the compiler can't
find the variable CFunTab. I solved this by adding the following
lines after #include "R_ext/Rdynpriv.h" :

    #include "../unix/FFDecl.h"
    static CFunTabEntry CFunTab[] =
    {
    #include "../unix/FFTab.h"
      {NULL, NULL}
    };

Now, make runs a bit further, until it stops with the following
errors:

       moduleCdynload (code)
    /usr/ccs/bin/ld: Found 4 duplicate symbol(s)
    *** Error exit code 1

Why is there an object gnome.o when I don't have Gnome support?

I had to make some more changes to several files before all
compiled OK.

In src/main/Rdynload.c I changed this:

    #ifdef HAVE_DLFCN_H

into this:

    #ifndef HAVE_DLFCN_H

In src/unix/hpdlfcn.c I removed the following functions:
    dlerror
    dlopen
    dlclose
    dlsym

Now make runs without errors. After make install I had to do
chmod +x R.bin.

R seems the work fine now.

<<insert bug report here>>

barplot hardcodes xpd as "TRUE" causing the bars to go outside of the
plot region.  True can be the default, but it shouldn't be the only
option.

Subject: Debian Woody r-base depends on blas2

Full_Name: Michael J. O'Donnell
Version: 1.3.1-1
OS: Linux, Debian Woody distribution
Submission from: (NULL) (64.34.17.133)


I tried to install the R packages for the Debian GNU/Linux Woody distribution.
I added "deb http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian woody main" to
my /etc/apt/sources.list, and ran dselect with the apt-get method.
I selected all of the R packages that I could find. The installation
appeared to fail, because r-base and r-recommended both depend on blas2.
I cannot find a Debian package for blas2 in the Debian archives, nor in
the CRAN archives. blas1 is in the Debian archives for both Potato and Woody.
I also checked the package list for your Debian Potato distribution, and
I found no dependence on blas2 nor on blas1 there.

Hmm. Yes, this looks wrong, but what are the ill effects? When you
use help.start(), doesn't the correct setting get put into
.R/doc/html/packages.html ?

It's not a problem with sum:

> sum(a*a)
[1] 333833500
> sum(b*b)
[1] 333833500

are accurate.

The overflow is in the integer arithmetic for *.  That's a question for
your C run-time system.  On a 64-bit machine you might get different
results (although most use 32-bit ints, including mine).

If you use integers you need to be aware of the consequences.  It's a
feature not a bug.

I thought R used an internal rep that was double in all cases.
Now I'm confused:
> a<-(1:1000)    
> b<-(1:1000)
> sum(a*a)*sum(b*b)
[1] -652010736
> a<-(1:1000)/1.0
> b<-(1:1000)/1.0
> sum(a*a)*sum(b*b)
[1] 1.114448e+17

So  R somehow decides whether to use an integer or a double
representation? Please tell me the rule used by R so I will know in the
future.

Thanks!

Bill

Subject:  rowsum dimnames 

The result of rowsum() in R doesn't have the dimnames I'd expect, e.g.:

> rowsum(matrix(1:12, 3,4), c("Y","X","Y"))
    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  1    2    5    8   11
  2    4   10   16   22

whereas S-Plus gives the more useful result:
    [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] 
  X    2    5    8   11
  Y    4   10   16   22

This is because R's rowsum() code gives the first dimnames as "ugroup", which
is a factor, rather than "as.character(ugroup)".  Similarly for the assignment
of names(x) in the case where x is a vector.

I'm using R 1.3.0 on Solaris 2.6.  Help says rowsum's author is Terry Therneau.
Thanks!
