as.hclust returns objects with only 6 of the standard 7 
components of class hclust, leaving out "method", therefore
being incompatible with applications looking for all
7 components.

Subject: Error in lme?

Full_Name: Simon Frost
Version: 1.0.0
OS: Windows
Submission from: (NULL) (129.215.60.79)


Hi everyone,

I've just installed R for Windows - I've previously been using it on Linux -
and I've run into a problem when using lme.

The lme routine throws up an error in the getGroups.data.frame command,
complaining about an error in the formula:

Error in getGroups.data.frame(dataMix, groups) : 
        Invalid formula for groups

getGroups works just fine, and I haven't run into this problem previously.

Any ideas?

Best wishes
Simon

Could you send us an example call that generates this error
(preferably using one of the data sets that comes with R)?

When dmvnorm is applied to matrices it fails.  The offending lines are

  if (length(x) != ncol(sigma)) {
    stop("x and sigma have non-conforming size")
  }

which works fine if x is a dataframe, but not if x is a matrix.

Replacing this test with

  if (ncol(x) != ncol(sigma)) {
    stop("x and sigma have non-conforming size")
  }

Corrects the problem, and still works for data frames and
vectors.  (Vectors have already been converted to matrices).

I am using R 0.65.1 under linux (Redhat 6.0),
and I have a problem with the est.variogram function when the first lag is empty (I am trying to estimate anisotropic varios)

fittedpnt<-point(fitted, x="X2", y="X3")
fittedpair<-pair(fittedpnt, num.lags=15, type="anisotropic", theta=60, dtheta=20, maxdist=maxfittedist)
fittedvario<-est.variogram(fittedpnt, fittedpair, "fit")

With my datas I have no pair in lags 1 to 3 and the error message is :
Error in psort(x, partial) : index 0 outside bounds

What can I do, in order to fix the bug ?

Hello,

were 
found which had the same error.  Here is the output.

That's a symbol from the Fortran I/O code.  There is no problem on RH6.0
on R 1.0.1, where the symbol is resolved from libg2c.a.

(1) Does FLIBS in etc/Makeconf include -lg2c?

(2) If so, do those packages have Makefiles in src? If so delete them
and reinstall.  (The latest version of akima does not, but earlier versions
did.)

(3) Does lg2c include e_wsfe?  (nm -g on it).  Is it finding the right
libg2c.a?

(4) I get nm -g ..../akima.so  giving

00013c5c T e_wsfe

and so I think it should be resolved in the *.so.

Which version of RedHat?  I suspect a RedHat inconsistency here, and other
people have reported that upgrading to the gcc-2.95.2 compiler set
solved the problem.  But it might just be old package versions.

That name e_wsfe probably comes from Fortran input/output routines.
Check if some Fortran code is trying to use a WRITE statement.  I
think there was another message this morning about this.

But did you build the packages yourself and if so, how? (using which
compilers).

BTW: when you follow up on an earlier report via the web interface,
please do it as a follow-up. If you do it by mail, say for PR#533,
please include (PR#533) in the Subject line. That way things get filed
together. (I've fixed the number on this mail)

I've just dl the .rpm of R 1.0.1, installed it and then launched 

	insatll.packages("akima")

after re-launching R [--vanilla], the command

	library(akima)

has the only effect to coredump the program. Here is the output of gdb and

Hmm. Doesn't happen here. (BTW: Remember to include as much
information about your system as you can think of. It's not obvious
whether you're running RedHat or SuSE for instance and in what
version.)

This would seem to be the problem: the dynamic library isn't there.
Did you get any error messages while compiling the package? (Except
for "...might be used uninitialized..." of which there are quite a few
here too).

Oh. Didn't see that. Then that part is OK. Sorry.

Hmmm. Interesting: I can provoke the crash on *my other* RedHat6.2
computer (the one still running the egcs compiler). My stack trace says

Looks like it is happening during the dynamic linking itself. Doesn't
look nice. (But installing gcc 2.95.2 might fix your problem.)

Submission from: (NULL) (128.32.251.234)


This is an update to bug report 548.

The bug had two parts on my system:
1) the gnome-interface puts the "*" mark in the wrong place. It could be
superscript 
or something else. From the Docs the gnome-interface claimed just to re-display
the 
base R but it is obviously doing something more and breaking the display.

1) the X11() interface. I can no longer reproduce the bug. Yesterday, the mark
was 
off everytime by a pixel today it is fine. 

I have contacted the person in charge of the gnome-Interface port so this should
be 
considered a bug of that unless I can start reproducing the X11() offset.

Thanks,
adrian.

Please put PR#548 in the subject line for a follow-up. And *please*
mention critical facts like which graphics device you were using.

> The bug had two parts on my system:

Can you tell us please where you read that in the docs, so we can
correct it?  It is a completely separate graphics device, to be called
gtk() from 1.1.0 (and the X11-based x11() will also be available).


> 1) the X11() interface. I can no longer reproduce the bug. Yesterday, the mark

*one* pixel?  I don't think you can expect one-pixel accuracy, not
least as where the centre of `*' is in the font used on my screen is
unclear to less than about half pixel.  Accuracy to one pixel seems fine
on a screen device, provided it is consistent.  You can expect greatest
accuracy on the hardcopy devices, where it may matter.

If you mean Lyndon Drake, he has moved and as far as we know is no
longer working on R.

A little more followup.  The gtk() device uses gdk_string_width to
find the character extents. That seems undocumented anywhere in the
gtk+ sources.  It is returning the maximal descent for the font for all
input strings on my system.  Looking at the current gtk+-1.2.7 sources it
appears to call XTextExtents, and that _should_ give the
string descent.

Since gdk fonts are private opaque structures I see no way around this.
Without any documentation I do not even know if it is a gdk bug (although
I suspect it is or was).  The gdk docs in gtk+ seem seriously incomplete.

The best thing that can be said about the GNOME API documentation is
that it is getting better.  Documentation on glib, gdk and gtk+ is
available from here:

http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/

but is still quite sparse.  

This is not, in fact, a gdk bug, but is due to a permutation in
the arguments of gdk_string_extents in GTK_MetricInfo 
(file src/gnome/devGTK.c). It currently reads

    gdk_string_extents(gtkd->font, tmp,
                       &lbearing, &rbearing,
                       &iascent, &idescent, &iwidth);

but should be

    gdk_string_extents(gtkd->font, tmp,
                       &lbearing, &rbearing,
                       &iwidth, &iascent, &idescent);

http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gdk/gdk-fonts.html#GDK-STRING-EXTENTS

Great, thanks, that solves it.  Now I was looking for a man page
for gdk_string_extents to find out what the arguments were supposed to mean,
but never found one.

Bug fixed for 1.1.0.

Subject:  axis() deficiency 

This is more a deficiency than a bug.  The axis() function does
not seem to allow an axis to be placed internally on the plot (as
allowed by the argument pos to the corresponding S function).

The help information nevertheless has some reference to
"position" of the axis, (as well as side) as if there were some
choice about position other than side.

Bill Venables.

Bug in persp() bounding box:
If the surface being plotted extends below the lower z-axis boundary, the box
is
drawn with the wrong occlusion. The box is shown as being occluded by the
surface
even though it should be in front of the surface.

The box is correct for surface extending above the box. Problem is only for
surface extending below the box.

This exhibits the bug:

The character "*" displays too high in comparison to the graph space and other
characters in the plot. Consider:

> a_-0.15
> plot(c(0,100),c(0,1))
> for (i in 1:100){ points(i,(1-exp(a*i)),pch=".",col="blue")}
> for (i in 1:100){ points(i,(1-exp(a*i)),pch="*",col="red")}
> abline(1,0)

This may be a well understood effect of using display characters, but the "o" in
the
original plot call falls in the right place.

Can anyone reproduce this?  On my Solaris system the placing looks spot on
on X11 and postscript, so it looks to me to be a system-specific
font-metric problem.  I noticed it came from a beta OS (gnu-linux (mandrake
7.1beta)), and I am presumming that the X11 device was meant.

I don't see it either with current development sources. We used to get
that effect because "*" is a superscript asterisk (not a centered
operator) in the relevant X11 font, but Paul/Ross fixed that at some
point. Does example(points) look right on this system?

Setting argument 'lty' via par() to dased lines does not
affect 
how lines are drawn with 'lines()' -- they remain solid. 
Two
possible fixes:
1) Have 'lty' affect the behavior of 'lines()'
2) Leave behavior as is, indicating in the documentation
that
the default is '1' and not 'par("lty")'.

Note:  Option 1 is more consistent with how the 'col'
argument to
par() is handled.

It looks as though you are trying to use GNU readline without it being
present.  This shouldn't be allowed by configure.

Try 
     make distclean
     ./configure
     make

again, to see if the problem goes away. If it doesn't then
look at src/include/config.h to see if you have something like
/* GNU Readline Library */
#define HAVE_LIBREADLINE 1
#define HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H 1
#define HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H 1
indicating that configure thinks you have readline or like
/* GNU Readline Library */
/* #undef HAVE_LIBREADLINE */
/* #undef HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H */
/* #undef HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H */
indicating that it doesn't.

In either case there would be a problem with configure, but a different
one. It's possible, for example, that configure is finding the readline
headers but that the compiler isn't looking in the same place.

Of course this is assuming you do have the GNU readline library and
headers. If you don't, then
	./configure --without-readline
is a workaround, though we would still like to know why configure thinks
you have it.

That's a pretty heavy set of optimization options you're using there!

Basically, there are two possibilities:

1) You've triggered a compiler bug
2) You've triggered a bug in R

In either case, you'll have to dig deeper and see if you can catch the
exact spot where things go wrong. You might start R with the debugger,
run the base-Ex.R with it while having a breakpoint set at the error
message you are getting. But before that try running the example that
triggers the bug by itself and see if the bug is still tickled.

Don't shure what I should think about it. 

my compiler is:

>gcc --version
2.95.2

R is compiled using the

"-fPIC -O3 -fstrict-aliasing -ffast-math -funroll-loops -mpentiumpro -march=pentiumpro -fschedule-insns2"

compiler switches. I used 

./configure --with-g77 --enable-blas_risc --enable-readline --with-x

for configuring.

I can't help noticing that you are configuring for a RISC optimized BLAS
library on an Intel x86 processor.  I have no idea if this is serious,
but it seems a bit odd.

Since this feature was added for PowerPC Linux distributions at my
request, I'll comment on this.  I would say that it is very unlikely to
be of any help, but it probably won't hurt.  The configure script will
check to see if libblas_risc can be located.  If it can't be found, it
won't be used.  Configure won't even look for it unless you request it
with --enable-blas_risc.

Furthermore, I don't believe that configure will actually use
libblas_risc unless you also --enable-blas.  I could be wrong in that
regard.  Using --enable-blas_risc could implicitly --enable-blas as
well. It's been many months since I wrote that configure option.  I do
know that configure will test if linking -lblas works first.  If that
fails, it won't even bother with -lblas_risc.  

Hope this helps,

Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

...but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


I reported this on r-help, but here is official bug report.

The present convolve() does not do convolution by default. Its default behaviour
is
correlation. This is a bug.

The default argument conj should be set to FALSE.

The zero-padding should be on the right for linear convolution (don't ask me
why you call this type="open"; I suggest type="linear").

Here is what I expect linear convolution to do:
myconvolve<-function (x,h) 
{
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    #zero pad
    if(nx>nh)
       {
       x <- c(x,rep(0, nh-1))
       h<-c(h,rep(0,nx-1))
       }
    else
       {
       h <- c(h,rep(0, nx-1))
       x<-c(x,rep(0,nh-1))
       }
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/length(x)
#I am not sure about this, the R IFFT is weird
}

What "circular" convolution should do is just
eliminate the zero-padding:

myconvolve2<-function (x,h)
{
#no padding, circular convolution
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/(nx)
}


I suggest that you create two functions, convolve() and correlate(), and get
rid
of the conj argument in convolve().

Dear all,

I was playing around with some C-code that I dynamically linked to R
and noticed the following inconsistency:

> dat <- matrix(1,3,3)
> is.double(dat)
[1] TRUE
> is.integer(dat)
[1] FALSE
> dat <- matrix(1:9,3,3)
> is.double(dat)
[1] FALSE
> is.integer(dat)
[1] TRUE

How did I find out?  I passed `dat' to a double * in the C-code and
printed out the matrix from C.  But in the .C() call I just passed
down `dat' and forgot to coerce to double via `as.double(dat)'.  Of
course the print out from the C routine was garbage, but since I used
        dat <- matrix(1,3,3)
first, I was confused.  Note that R says that `dat' is.double!  But it
seems to pass dat to C as an integer matrix nevertheless!  Using the
second matrix it became clear to me why I saw garbage being printed
out from the C-routine.  My question is now why does the first
`is.double(dat)' returns `TRUE'?

Cheers,

        Berwin

Because it is double!   This refers to the storage mode, not the
mathematical properties of the object's content.

I can find no inconsistency.  1 is double, and 1:9 is integer (just as
in S-PLUS 3.x).  Why should this not be the case?  Currently the
only time in R you are likely to get an integer result is a : or seq
expression, but you are not supposed to rely on this.  (Since I know
you have a copy, this is exactly the problem of the wam example
on page 203 of `S Prograaming'.)

For example, if printit.c is

void printit(double *x, int *n)
{
    int i;
    
    for(i = 0; i < *n; i++) printf("[%d] %f\n", i, x[i]);
}

> dat <- matrix(1,3,3)
> is.double(dat)
[1] TRUE
> invisible(.C("printit", dat, as.integer(9)))
[0] 1.000000
[1] 1.000000
[2] 1.000000
[3] 1.000000
[4] 1.000000
[5] 1.000000
[6] 1.000000
[7] 1.000000
[8] 1.000000
>  dat <- matrix(1:9,3,3)
> invisible(.C("printit", dat, as.integer(9)))
[0] 0.000000
[1] 0.000000
[2] 0.000000
[3] 0.000000
[4] 0.000000
[5] 0.000000
[6] 0.000000
[7] 0.000000
[8] 0.000000

as I would expect.

I think the moral is that you cannot assume the storage mode of
expressions returned by R (or by S).

Also, there are other functions guaranteeing an integer (or NA / NULL)

 o length()

If an error occurs during a save the file does not appear to be
closed and buffers flushed.  This can lead to corruption if the same
filename is used later and then the buffer is flushed on program exit.

For example, tn the context of PR #504

 f<-function(x,...){ function(y) list(x=x,y=y,...)}
 a<-f(1,2,3)
 save(list="a",file="a.rdata")  ## -- error --
 b<-1:10
 save(list="b",file="a.rdata")
 load("a.rdata")  ## works
 q("no")
 
 R

 load("a.rdata")  ## error



This is R1.0 on Linux

I tried this, but it does not work :

try(autoload(..)) works okay when used after startup, but not *during*
startup.  However, I'll put a workaround into Common.R

Should this {try(.) not working during startup} be another bug report ?

(i.e. my version Solaris, see below...)

Note that system() is not only implemented quite system-dependently
(which you'd very much expect!) but also Unix and Windows have quite
different arguments apart from the first two.

Hence all the following is ``Unix-only'' :


A user stumbled across this when using read.table.url(.) on a platform
where no "wget" is installed: 

The data is read ok, but an ugly message appears *before* the command is
completed :
	  -------------------
	  sh: wget: not found
	  -------------------
which made the user believe that the data wasn't read properly.

The problem is easily tracked to the system(..) call in download.file()
{which does not (yet) have the "ignore.stderr = TRUE" setting, btw}
and found that on our Solaris environment, 
the ignore.stderr argument does not seem to have any effect, i.e.

  > system("bla", ignore.stderr = TRUE)

gives the same as  system("bla"), namely
  
  sh: bla: not found
 
On my Linux environment,  ignore.stderr works as advertized.

Further note that  help(system)  should probably also say something about which
shell may or may not be used (I think we decided that we want it to be `sh'
on Unix).

Under sh you cannot redirect the output from a command until the command
is running.  That is, you are not redirecting the error messages from sh,
only from the command.  Unless the command runs, ignore.stderr has no
effect.

> On my Linux environment,  ignore.stderr works as advertized.

Depends how you read the advertising.

Yes, and you almost certainly got bash *not* sh on your Linux, and that
behaves differently.  I think you will find that a closer sh clone (such as
ash) does show the error message.  That some Linux systems claim to have sh
and do not is a major compatibility problem in writing shell scripts and
Makefiles, as we keep finding.

BTW, Solaris will use ksh not sh for the shell if it needs to be POSIX
compatible. And ksh behaves like bash in this respect.


I believe that to define this portably we are going to have to do something
a lot more complicated than accept what the system() call gives us. Are you
volunteering, Martin?

Hi,  I get the wrong eigen values on an AIX machine with R-devel of 5/3/00.

Here are the results:

R> m <- matrix (c(6.8, 2.4, 2.4, 8.2), nrow=2)
R> m
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  6.8  2.4
[2,]  2.4  8.2
R> eigen(m)
$values
[1] 19.281403  6.337993

$vectors
          [,1]       [,2]
[1,] 0.1918866  0.9967987
[2,] 0.9967987 -0.1918866


And for comparison, here is what I get on a Sun (with r-stable):

R> m <- matrix (c(6.8, 2.4, 2.4, 8.2), nrow=2)
R> eigen (m)
$values
[1] 10  5

$vectors
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]  0.6  0.8
[2,]  0.8 -0.6


I found this by running "make check" which also stumbles over svd.
Please let me know how I can help to investigate this.

Hmm. We had a similar report a while back and it turned out to be
system specific. I believe the report was from Chong Gu.

When we last saw this bug it was compiler-specific.  gcc/g77 worked but
cc/f77 didn't (and I think gcc/f77 wouldn't even configure). 

I don't think we understand the bug, though.

Digital Alpha (various), Digital UNIX V4.0[EF], R-1.0.0, gcc, f77

When using batch mode with the save option, an error message is issued.
However [I have just discovered that] it appears that the operation
does complete, i.e. the .RData file is saved successfully.  The main
problem is that the return code is non-zero (and so it is impossible to
distinguish this "non-error" from some other error in a script).

Reproduce by:

    bats>  echo 'x <- 1' | R --save

Note that an alternate form that achieves the same desired effect does
not issue any error messages:

    echo 'x <- 1; save(list = ls(), file = ".RData")' | R --no-save

I can't find any record of the configure summary output (is it saved
anywhere, or does it only appear on the screen?) but I could reproduce
this if necessary.

I'm having sporadic problems with glm on my alpha workstation running
Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0 (I can't replicate the problem on my Linux PC). I
have the same problem whether I use a version of R built with the native
C-compiler or a version compiled with gcc. In both cases I've built with
g77.

I want to do some simulations with a call to glm in each rep. A simplified
version would be something like:

N_100; NREPS_100; lam.e_5; logit.inv_function(x){ exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) }
for(i in (1:NREPS)) {
   cat(paste("REP",i,"\n"))
   T_rexp(N,(lam.e))
   Delta_rbinom(N,1,logit.inv(1+T))
   ff_glm(Delta ~ T,family=binomial(logit))
}
 
It often completes all reps, but I occasionally get errors related to
lengths of various objects, etc.:

REP 1 
REP 2
<snip>
REP 9 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : variable lengths differ


REP 1 
<snip>
REP 53 
Error: subscript out of bounds

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 41 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type

Different error messages, different numbers of reps. When I call glm again
using the values of T and Delta just before the error, it runs error-free.
When I put the data in a data frame before calling glm I can also get
messages like:

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 64 
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras, extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

I just did the above ~10 times on i386 and nothing happened. We've had
previous reports on trouble in the lm/glm/model.matrix etc. region on
Alpha. 

If you compile with all warnings on, are you getting warnings on
pointer/integer comparisons or assignments?

Can you create a reproducible case (with set.seed to keep the random
generator sequence constant) and would you know how run a debugger on
your version so that we can figure out what is going wrong?

I'll see what I can do about getting a more reproducible error. 

Any tips on what to look for if I'm running R within GDB? I don't have
much experience with the debugger. I mostly just use it to see where my
programs are dying. But R is not -- it just gives strange error messages.

TIA,
Brad

(Two suggestions which are in the current snapshot follow. Looks like
what is which header varies a bit.)

Add a line (third one here) to src/include/R_ext/RS.h:

#ifndef R_RS_H
#define R_RS_H

#include <string.h> /* for memcpy */
#include "Rconfig.h" /* for F77_SYMBOL */

Those are all normal.

That looks like a regex bug, with a why? comment in the code. Change
(int) to (long), twice.

I've never seen those, but try adding

One technique is to set a breakpoint at the line that displays the
error, then you can inspect the condition that caused it (you may have
to go "up" a couple of times to get into an interesting environment.)

Sometimes, it turns out that a variable contains something that it
shouldn't due to memory corruption and then you may have to set a
breakpoint earlier in the code and then maybe a watchpoint on the
memory location.

Another thing that is useful even without gdb is to investigate the
output of traceback() and maybe set 

options(error=quote(DUMP <<- sys.status()))

which allows you to subsequently investigate any active environment at
the time of the error, e.g. using ls(envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]), and
get("x",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]).

(Newer snapshots have a more elaborate dump.frames function, but the
above should do).

I looked into the glm problem some more. Seems to be a memory problem that
occurs just after garbage collection. The easiest way for me to
reproduce  the error is in lapply. I take a list and ask lapply to provide
the descriptive stat summary. I do this several times with the same list.
Most often it gives the correct summary, but just after allocSExp calls
R_gc, one of the summaries for a list element will be NULL. 

E.g for a data frame dat with five columns I get the following (having added
print statements in summary.default and in allocSExp just after the test
for whether gc is necessary):

> lapply(as.list(dat), summary, maxsum = maxsum)
[1] "exiting summary.default"
R_FreeSEXP == NULL  
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"

I don't know if the following is relevant, but for some reason I've found 
I can avoid this particular problem if I make a small change in lapply in 
its main loop.  Around line 50 of apply.c:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(R_fcall, rho);
    }

if I change it to make an assignment to a
temporary variable first everything seems to work fine:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        tem = eval(R_fcall, rho);
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = tem;
    }

hasn't given me any NULLs yet.

Now that is pretty darn odd... Looks quite a bit like a compiler bug.
Those two pieces of code should be equivalent as far as I can see.

One thing that you might do: objdump -dS apply.o allows you to see
what code the compiler generates for the two cases. Also, of course,
you can try reducing the level of optimization.


Alternatively, the mere addition of "tem" changes the local memory use
of that function so that something that got clobbered before doesn't
get clobbered now.

The effect doesn't seem to be present on Intels:

> dfr<-do.call("data.frame",lapply(1:100,function(i)rnorm(100)))
> any(sapply(lapply(dfr,summary),is.null))
[1] FALSE

Just to update: What I originally thought was a glm problem appears to be
a memory problem that occurs only when R is compiled with the DEC C
compiler. Some variables that are still in use get clobbered during
garbage collection. No problems if I compile with gcc though. I've made
some attempts to see if I can identify a specific compiler optimization
that is responsible, but so far no luck.

===== R.bug.report =============================================
Hello,

We're experiencing problems with R 1.0.1 on the HP-UX system.
The most serious one is that the random-number generators don't work:

        R> runif(100)
        Error in runif(100) : .Random.seed[0] is not a valid Normal type

        R> .Random.seed
        [1] 18851  3338  2439

Is this a subscripting error?  Strange because building it on linux
works just fine.

Smaller errors I've noticed...  The command-line history doesn't work.
It was built by our computer-support people, and I think they had
trouble with the libraries for that.  (Contact is Ben Sherman,
bsherman@divms.uiowa.edu).  Also help.start() generates a bunch of
error messages:

R> help.start()
If netscape  is already running,        it is *not* restarted,
 and you must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient..

I think you've got a (very) old workspace being loaded there. Try starting
with R --vanilla to cross-check.

Subject: text() with large cex parameter crashes X11()

Trying to use text() with very large cex parameter crashes
R when using the X11() device

X11()
plot(1,1,type="n")
text(1,1,"foo", cex=10)

This also crashes R

points(1,1,pch="A", cex=10)

presumably because we are trying to load a font that doesn't
exist, but I haven't looked into it.

Works also for me, RH 6.2 Linux; both with 1.0.1 and R-devel [of today];
also work for R running on Solaris (2.5.1, X11R6.3) with DISPLAY on Linux.

As a matter of interest, does it crash R-devel?  I added some X11 error
handlers a couple of weeks ago, so X11 errors should no longer crash R.

Hello!

I'm afraid I have another obscure bug. 
R has just crashed with a segmentation fault. 
This time, I have even failed to reproduce it, but fortunately, 
I have a core dump. It's at 
<URL:http://www.astro.uio.no/~kjetikj/tmp/core>

The call I did was 
log10(quantile(chisqtests5M11001, c(0.05, 0.95)))
where chisqtests5M11001 is an array of length 1500 
(it's an array of p-values produced by the chisq.test, but I 
doubt that it is relevant). 

I did lots of strange things prior to the crash, some even 
involving for-loops, but I can't tell what is relevant. Anyway,
a transcript of the session is at 
<URL:http://www.astro.uio.no/~kjetikj/tmp/crash.Rt>

That's all I've got....

Submission from: (NULL) (129.240.28.227)


Hello again!

This is a follow-up to my message on R-help about a problem with match.arg()
I have a little more on the topic, but not much really. 

First, it was not entirely true what I wrote in r-help that I call match.arg()
in my ramp(), because ramp() just calls qamp() with runif() as argument, but 
I have found that it happens both in ramp() and qamp().

Last night, just before I went home, R crashed with a segmentation fault. 
Unfortunately, I had limit coredumpsize 0, because I seldom want core-files,
so I haven't got it. I have removed that limit now. I have not been able to 
reproduce the crash, however.

Now, for a
> last.dump

<environment: 140e187f0>

attr(,"error.message")
[1] "Error in arg == choices : comparison (1) is possible only for vector
types\n"
attr(,"class")
[1] "dump.frames"

I have also inserted some print statements at some places in the code. First:
qamp <- function(p,  type=c("point", "nolens"))
{
  print(c(2,type))
  type <- match.arg(type)
  if(type == "point")
    return(1 / (2 * sqrt(1 - p)))
  else return(1)
}
  
ramp <- function(n, type=c("point", "nolens"))
{
  print(c(1,type))
  type <- match.arg(type)
  if(type == "point")
    return(qamp(runif(n), type))
  else return(rep(1, n))
}
(I'll rewrite these to use switch eventually).

And, also in match.arg():
match.arg <- function (arg, choices) {
    if (missing(choices)) {
	formal.args <- formals(sys.function(sys.parent()))
	choices <- eval(formal.args[[deparse(substitute(arg))]])
    }
    print(c(2, arg, choices))
    if (all(arg == choices)) return(choices[1])
[...]
Upon running, I get
[1] "1"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "2"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[thousands of these... :-) ]
[1] "1"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "2"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "1"     "point"
[1] "point"  "point"  "nolens"
[1] "2"     "point"
[1] "point"
Error in arg == choices : comparison (1) is possible only for vector types
So, suddenly, "choices" doesn't have a value, and consequently, the error.
FWIW, I have also printed formals(qamp)$type inside qamp, and it has the 
right value. 

Now, it seems hard to reproduce, I just did 100000 runs of ramp(10000, "point")

directly with no problems. In my code, ramp is called by a function that is
called
by a function, that is... :-) 

However, the code isn't very involved, really, so if you want to try, here it
is:
ncloudsbin <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins = 100,
                       linewidth = numberofbins / 6)
  return(ntotalclouds * dnorm(binno, sd = linewidth))

intensityfromcloud <- function(ncloudsbin, cloudintensity, exptime, amptype)
  return(cloudintensity * exptime * ramp(ncloudsbin, amptype))

photonsdetectedbin <- function(ncloudsbin, intensityfromcloud,
                               continuumintensity, exptime, amptype,
                               sensitivity)
  return(sum(rpois(ncloudsbin, sensitivity * intensityfromcloud))
         + rgeom(1, 1 /(1 + (sensitivity * exptime * continuumintensity))))



lineprofile <- function(ntotalclouds, intensityfromcloud, continuumintensity,
                        exptime, amptype, sensitivity = 0.1, numberofbins =
100,
                        linewidth = numberofbins / 6)
{
  tf <- function(binno, ntotalclouds, intensityfromcloud, continuumintensity,
                 exptime, amptype, sensitivity, numberofbins, linewidth)
  {
    ncb <- ncloudsbin(binno, ntotalclouds, numberofbins, linewidth)
    return(photonsdetectedbin(ncb,
                   intensityfromcloud(
                            ncb, intensityfromcloud, exptime, amptype),
                   continuumintensity, exptime, amptype, sensitivity))
  }
  return(apply(cbind(-as.integer(numberofbins/2):as.integer(numberofbins/2)),
               1, tf,
               ntotalclouds, intensityfromcloud, continuumintensity,
               exptime, amptype, sensitivity, numberofbins, linewidth)) 
}

Note that "amptype" is here the "type" of the ?amp-functions. 
I call this by e.g. 
ll25000 <- apply(cbind(rep(100000, 25000)), 1, lineprofile, 10, 100, 1,
"point")


Just an idea: I have some problems in an entirely unrelated and more involved 
piece of code where it seems like sometimes, arguments are not returned from a 
function, that is, one variable of an object suddenly has no value. I haven't
really figured out if that is a bug of mine or in R, but could it be possible 
that something in
	formal.args <- formals(sys.function(sys.parent()))
	choices <- eval(formal.args[[deparse(substitute(arg))]])
doesn't get a value because there is an error in how objects are returned 
from a function?

BTW, I was exiting R (my ESS buffer was getting rather large), and I got the
following:
Save workspace image? [y/n/c]: y
Error: NewWriteItem: unknown type 17

Well, I guess this isn't much go on, but I know you are really good at this!
By running the above code, the error happens on every run here, it is just a
matter
of letting it run for long enough. I hope it is something to start on. I have a
few
more last.dumps on file too, if they are of use.

That one was fixed in 1.0.1, I believe. (Perhaps you should upgrade
and see if the other problem goes away too... I don't see anything
obviously relevant in the NEWS file though)

It's much worse than that, as this happens n times inside a loop.
It looks to me as if the code has fairly thoroughly confused character
strings and character vectors.  I suspect it should be more like

	    for (j = 0 ; j < n ; j++) {
		s = allocSExp(CHARSXP);
		CHAR(s) = ((char**)(arguments[i]))[j];
		LENGTH(s) = strlen(CHAR(s));
		STRING(CAR(pcall))[j] = s;
	    }

or, more consisely

	    for (j = 0 ; j < n ; j++) {
		cptr = (char**)arguments[i]
		STRING(CAR(pcall))[j] = mkChar(cptr[j])
	    }

Do you have a succinct example on which we could test out solutions?

Ouch, another obscure bug...
I just had a bus error crash, with a core dump, a small one this time.
Usual <URL:http://www.astro.uio.no/~kjetikj/tmp/core>.
I had done a few simulations, and done a chisq.test() on them.
These simulations also write about 190MB's to file, but
I have no idea whether that is relevant, and those data are not
used. The calls I do look like this:
> ch1 <- chisq.test(t(apply(cbind(rep(5000000, 4)), 1, lineprofile, 1, 100,
"point")))
> ch1

	 Pearson's Chi-square test 

data:  t(apply(cbind(rep(5e+06, 4)), 1, lineprofile, 1, 100, "point")) 
X-squared = 463.8359, df = 300, p-value = 3.726e-09 

> ch1$observed

Process R bus error (core dumped) at Mon May 22 12:38:49 2000


....so it doesn't crash when I print the whole object, but when I 
a vector of the object, it crashes... And, restarting R, it doesn't
happen.

I heard the sysadm who did the installation had some problems,
I don't know what it was about, but if I understood him correctly,
it only happened when he tuned for EV6, so it shouldn't be a problem now, 
I guess....
