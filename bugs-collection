When dmvnorm is applied to matrices it fails.  The offending lines are

  if (length(x) != ncol(sigma)) {
    stop("x and sigma have non-conforming size")
  }

which works fine if x is a dataframe, but not if x is a matrix.

Replacing this test with

  if (ncol(x) != ncol(sigma)) {
    stop("x and sigma have non-conforming size")
  }

Corrects the problem, and still works for data frames and
vectors.  (Vectors have already been converted to matrices).

I am using R 0.65.1 under linux (Redhat 6.0),
and I have a problem with the est.variogram function when the first lag is empty (I am trying to estimate anisotropic varios)

fittedpnt<-point(fitted, x="X2", y="X3")
fittedpair<-pair(fittedpnt, num.lags=15, type="anisotropic", theta=60, dtheta=20, maxdist=maxfittedist)
fittedvario<-est.variogram(fittedpnt, fittedpair, "fit")

With my datas I have no pair in lags 1 to 3 and the error message is :
Error in psort(x, partial) : index 0 outside bounds

What can I do, in order to fix the bug ?

Hi everyone,

I've just installed R for Windows - I've previously been using it on Linux -
and I've run into a problem when using lme.

The lme routine throws up an error in the getGroups.data.frame command,
complaining about an error in the formula:

Error in getGroups.data.frame(dataMix, groups) : 
        Invalid formula for groups

getGroups works just fine, and I haven't run into this problem previously.

Any ideas?

Best wishes
Simon

Could you send us an example call that generates this error
(preferably using one of the data sets that comes with R)?

Cc: berwin@bossiaea.maths.uwa.edu.au

Dear R developers,

first of all let me join the chorus of congratulations for the release
of R 1.0.0.  Well, done!

Unfortunately, I find it necessary to e-mail in a bug report regarding
the `nlme' package.  On my office machine I experience the following
trouble:

bossiaea:/opt/R$ R CMD check -c nlme 
Checking package `nlme' ...
 Massaging examples into `nlme-Ex.R' ...
 Running examples in package `nlme' ...
 ERROR

The end of nlme-Ex.Rout is:

(R CMD check MASS is also failing on an example that uses update.gls.)

On my machine at home I run into troubles even faster when running `R
CMD check nlme'.  One of the early examples chokes on the line:
> data(Orthodont)

I had done a "clean install" on that machine, i.e., I first blew away
the older installation of R.  It seems that the datasets Orthodont and
Pixel have been distributed with the nls library in earlier R versions
but not so in R 1.0.0.  But they are not distributed with the current
version of nlme either.

Cheers,

        Berwin

Subject:  Strange behaviour of image 

The following commands

z <- matrix(seq(0, 1, len=1000))
image(z, 1, z, zlim=c(0, 1), col=gray(1:10/10))

appear to violate the image functionality as described on the
help page.  As I understand it, by specifying a zlim of c(0, 1)
and a colour vector of length 10, the colours should correspond
to the intervals (0, 0.1), (0.1, 0.2), ..., (0.9, 1.0), this
being 10 equally-spaced intervals on (0, 1).  It is clear from
the image that this has not occurred.  In fact the intervals are
apparently (0, 1/18), (1/18, 3/18), ..., (15/18, 17/18), (17/18,
1).  Have I misunderstood something?

Cheers, Jonathan.

I don't see that anything else is being promised...

If someone actually thought about this, then the choice might be
related to the behavior at peaks and troughs. (since a circle with
radius r looks wide compared to the region between two circles with
diameter n*r and (n+1)*r)

Just to get these issues recorded in the bug repository:

a) We don't handle multiple window closes well

My "favourite" version of this is when I ^Z out of an R session with
an open graphics window to do something on the command line, then kill
the graphics window (which does nothing), kill it again, realise that
it's because the R session was stopped, and:

[pd@blueberry BUILD]$ %
bin/R
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

b) X11 errors should be caught by an error handler, not kill R.

This is mainly seen when there's an error somewhere else, such as
trouble with the font setup. But in principle, we should at worst shut
down the graphics window, not R itself.

Subject: persp box occlusion bug

Full_Name: Bill Simpson
Version: 64.1
OS: linux
Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


Bug in persp() bounding box:
If the surface being plotted extends below the lower z-axis boundary, the box
is
drawn with the wrong occlusion. The box is shown as being occluded by the
surface
even though it should be in front of the surface.

The box is correct for surface extending above the box. Problem is only for
surface extending below the box.

This exhibits the bug:

std<-rep(seq(-32,32,8),9)/1000 * 60
cf<-rep(seq(-32,32,8),rep(9,9))/1000 *60 
dp<-(cf-std)/.6
std<-unique(std)
cf<-unique(cf)
dp<-t(matrix(dp,length(cf),length(std)))
persp(std,cf,dp, xlim=c(-2,2), ylim=c(-2,2), zlim=c(0,5),theta=-40,    
phi=45,
box=TRUE,ltheta=-120, lphi=120,

Dear all,
a problem with barplot() was already discussed on R-help for R 0.90.0 - sorry,
if this is a known bug, but I was unable to find it in the bugs database.
In:
> barplot(c(.1,.5,1), ylim=(0:1))
or
> barplot(c(.1,.5,1), ylim=c(0,1))
the y axis is drawn from 0.2 to 0.8, in:
> barplot(c(.1,.5,1))
the y axis is drawn from 0.0 to 0.8.
As I was notified earlier by Peter Dalgaard, "the axis settings use yaxs='i' 
(or xaxs if horizontal) which sets the plot boundaries equal to the ylim 
(stated or computed) and marks the axes "internally". The endpoints of the 
axes are not considered to be internal."
Sorry again if this is already reported.
With regards
Zdenek Skala

I actually thought we had that one fixed, but obviously not ...
As usual, the workaround is to extend the ylim a tiny bit:

barplot(c(.1,.5,1), ylim=c(-.001,1.001))

Subject:  graphics bugs: steep slopes and large values beyond ylim 
Cc: ben@bolker-nt.zoo.ufl.edu


  Some of my students have uncovered some apparent graphics bugs in 
R.  I think they may manifest slightly different on different platforms/
with different display devices (they sometimes report a Windows graph
that looks OK but odd results on printing).
  I'm able to replicate similar problems on my Linux (RH 6.0) system.


1. abline() plots nothing, or a wrong line, when the slope is too steep.

plot(0:10,0:10)
abline(a=0,b=100)
abline(a=0,b=200)
abline(a=0,b=300)
abline(a=0,b=80)

2. when plotting with type "l" and with values far beyond the limits of
the plot, semi-random lines appear on the plot.

plot(exp(1:100),ylim=c(0,10),type="l")

Any thoughts?  I poked a little bit at this myself: abline calls GLine, neither of them
seems to do much checking whether the endpoints of the line to be drawn are way outside of the
window (I guess that XDrawLine, which gets called by GLine, can't handle this).
I guess this should probably be fixed at the the level of GLine (it might fix both of
the above problems, but I'm a little bit afraid digging this deeply into the graphics drivers.
  Maybe it will be obvious to someone closer to the code?

It looks as though you are trying to use GNU readline without it being
present.  This shouldn't be allowed by configure.

Try 
     make distclean
     ./configure
     make

again, to see if the problem goes away. If it doesn't then
look at src/include/config.h to see if you have something like
/* GNU Readline Library */
#define HAVE_LIBREADLINE 1
#define HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H 1
#define HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H 1
indicating that configure thinks you have readline or like
/* GNU Readline Library */
/* #undef HAVE_LIBREADLINE */
/* #undef HAVE_READLINE_HISTORY_H */
/* #undef HAVE_READLINE_READLINE_H */
indicating that it doesn't.

In either case there would be a problem with configure, but a different
one. It's possible, for example, that configure is finding the readline
headers but that the compiler isn't looking in the same place.

Of course this is assuming you do have the GNU readline library and
headers. If you don't, then
	./configure --without-readline
is a workaround, though we would still like to know why configure thinks
you have it.

I autoconfigured/configured the src'es w/o having XDR (#undef HAVE_RPC_XDR_H).

In saveload.c , at the beginning of the file the XDR code is enclosed by
matching #ifdefs.

But in the NEW_SAVE_FORMAT section, there are no #ifdefs around the XDR code.

Does this imply that using the new save format requires using XDR or is 
this simply an oversight?

The defines in R_SaveToFile and R_LoadFromFile determine what is 
actually used.  I think all that happens is that unused code is not
excluded from the compile (and that happens with the BinarySave code
if XDR is available).

That's a pretty heavy set of optimization options you're using there!

Basically, there are two possibilities:

1) You've triggered a compiler bug
2) You've triggered a bug in R

In either case, you'll have to dig deeper and see if you can catch the
exact spot where things go wrong. You might start R with the debugger,
run the base-Ex.R with it while having a breakpoint set at the error
message you are getting. But before that try running the example that
triggers the bug by itself and see if the bug is still tickled.

Don't shure what I should think about it. 

my compiler is:

>gcc --version
2.95.2

R is compiled using the

"-fPIC -O3 -fstrict-aliasing -ffast-math -funroll-loops -mpentiumpro -march=pentiumpro -fschedule-insns2"

compiler switches. I used 

./configure --with-g77 --enable-blas_risc --enable-readline --with-x

for configuring.

I can't help noticing that you are configuring for a RISC optimized BLAS
library on an Intel x86 processor.  I have no idea if this is serious,
but it seems a bit odd.

Since this feature was added for PowerPC Linux distributions at my
request, I'll comment on this.  I would say that it is very unlikely to
be of any help, but it probably won't hurt.  The configure script will
check to see if libblas_risc can be located.  If it can't be found, it
won't be used.  Configure won't even look for it unless you request it
with --enable-blas_risc.

Furthermore, I don't believe that configure will actually use
libblas_risc unless you also --enable-blas.  I could be wrong in that
regard.  Using --enable-blas_risc could implicitly --enable-blas as
well. It's been many months since I wrote that configure option.  I do
know that configure will test if linking -lblas works first.  If that
fails, it won't even bother with -lblas_risc.  

Hope this helps,

Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

...but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

> xx[["abc"]]<-123
> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, 123)

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

[R-0.99.0 prerelease on RedHat6.1, but this is likely not a new thing.]

Full_Name: Bill Simpson

OS: Linux
Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


I reported this on r-help, but here is official bug report.

The present convolve() does not do convolution by default. Its default behaviour
is
correlation. This is a bug.

The default argument conj should be set to FALSE.

The zero-padding should be on the right for linear convolution (don't ask me
why you call this type="open"; I suggest type="linear").

Here is what I expect linear convolution to do:
myconvolve<-function (x,h) 
{
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    #zero pad
    if(nx>nh)
       {
       x <- c(x,rep(0, nh-1))
       h<-c(h,rep(0,nx-1))
       }
    else
       {
       h <- c(h,rep(0, nx-1))
       x<-c(x,rep(0,nh-1))
       }
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/length(x)
#I am not sure about this, the R IFFT is weird
}

What "circular" convolution should do is just
eliminate the zero-padding:

myconvolve2<-function (x,h)
{
#no padding, circular convolution
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/(nx)
}


I suggest that you create two functions, convolve() and correlate(), and get
rid
of the conj argument in convolve().

If an error occurs during a save the file does not appear to be
closed and buffers flushed.  This can lead to corruption if the same
filename is used later and then the buffer is flushed on program exit.

For example, tn the context of PR #504

 f<-function(x,...){ function(y) list(x=x,y=y,...)}
 a<-f(1,2,3)
 save(list="a",file="a.rdata")  ## -- error --
 b<-1:10
 save(list="b",file="a.rdata")
 load("a.rdata")  ## works
 q("no")
 
 R

 load("a.rdata")  ## error



This is R1.0 on Linux

I tried this, but it does not work :

try(autoload(..)) works okay when used after startup, but not *during*
startup.  However, I'll put a workaround into Common.R

Should this {try(.) not working during startup} be another bug report ?

Digital Alpha (various), Digital UNIX V4.0[EF], R-1.0.0, gcc, f77

When using batch mode with the save option, an error message is issued.
However [I have just discovered that] it appears that the operation
does complete, i.e. the .RData file is saved successfully.  The main
problem is that the return code is non-zero (and so it is impossible to
distinguish this "non-error" from some other error in a script).

Reproduce by:

    bats>  echo 'x <- 1' | R --save

Note that an alternate form that achieves the same desired effect does
not issue any error messages:

    echo 'x <- 1; save(list = ls(), file = ".RData")' | R --no-save

I can't find any record of the configure summary output (is it saved
anywhere, or does it only appear on the screen?) but I could reproduce
this if necessary.

I'm having sporadic problems with glm on my alpha workstation running
Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0 (I can't replicate the problem on my Linux PC). I
have the same problem whether I use a version of R built with the native
C-compiler or a version compiled with gcc. In both cases I've built with
g77.

I want to do some simulations with a call to glm in each rep. A simplified
version would be something like:

N_100; NREPS_100; lam.e_5; logit.inv_function(x){ exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) }
for(i in (1:NREPS)) {
   cat(paste("REP",i,"\n"))
   T_rexp(N,(lam.e))
   Delta_rbinom(N,1,logit.inv(1+T))
   ff_glm(Delta ~ T,family=binomial(logit))
}
 
It often completes all reps, but I occasionally get errors related to
lengths of various objects, etc.:

REP 1 
REP 2
<snip>
REP 9 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : variable lengths differ


REP 1 
<snip>
REP 53 
Error: subscript out of bounds

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 41 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type

Different error messages, different numbers of reps. When I call glm again
using the values of T and Delta just before the error, it runs error-free.
When I put the data in a data frame before calling glm I can also get
messages like:

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 64 
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras, extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

I just did the above ~10 times on i386 and nothing happened. We've had
previous reports on trouble in the lm/glm/model.matrix etc. region on
Alpha. 

If you compile with all warnings on, are you getting warnings on
pointer/integer comparisons or assignments?

Can you create a reproducible case (with set.seed to keep the random
generator sequence constant) and would you know how run a debugger on
your version so that we can figure out what is going wrong?

I'll see what I can do about getting a more reproducible error. 

Any tips on what to look for if I'm running R within GDB? I don't have
much experience with the debugger. I mostly just use it to see where my
programs are dying. But R is not -- it just gives strange error messages.

TIA,
Brad

Add a line (third one here) to src/include/R_ext/RS.h:

#ifndef R_RS_H
#define R_RS_H

#include <string.h> /* for memcpy */
#include "Rconfig.h" /* for F77_SYMBOL */

Those are all normal.

That looks like a regex bug, with a why? comment in the code. Change
(int) to (long), twice.

I've never seen those, but try adding

#define STDC_HEADERS 1

at the top of regex.c.  (I am not convinced that is the cause here.)

Normal, on a platform with xdr.

One technique is to set a breakpoint at the line that displays the
error, then you can inspect the condition that caused it (you may have
to go "up" a couple of times to get into an interesting environment.)

Sometimes, it turns out that a variable contains something that it
shouldn't due to memory corruption and then you may have to set a
breakpoint earlier in the code and then maybe a watchpoint on the
memory location.

Another thing that is useful even without gdb is to investigate the
output of traceback() and maybe set 

options(error=quote(DUMP <<- sys.status()))

which allows you to subsequently investigate any active environment at
the time of the error, e.g. using ls(envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]), and
get("x",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]).

(Newer snapshots have a more elaborate dump.frames function, but the
above should do).

I looked into the glm problem some more. Seems to be a memory problem that
occurs just after garbage collection. The easiest way for me to
reproduce  the error is in lapply. I take a list and ask lapply to provide
the descriptive stat summary. I do this several times with the same list.
Most often it gives the correct summary, but just after allocSExp calls
R_gc, one of the summaries for a list element will be NULL. 

E.g for a data frame dat with five columns I get the following (having added
print statements in summary.default and in allocSExp just after the test
for whether gc is necessary):

> lapply(as.list(dat), summary, maxsum = maxsum)
[1] "exiting summary.default"
R_FreeSEXP == NULL  
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"

I don't know if the following is relevant, but for some reason I've found 
I can avoid this particular problem if I make a small change in lapply in 
its main loop.  Around line 50 of apply.c:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(R_fcall, rho);
    }

if I change it to make an assignment to a
temporary variable first everything seems to work fine:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        tem = eval(R_fcall, rho);
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = tem;
    }

hasn't given me any NULLs yet.

Now that is pretty darn odd... Looks quite a bit like a compiler bug.
Those two pieces of code should be equivalent as far as I can see.

One thing that you might do: objdump -dS apply.o allows you to see
what code the compiler generates for the two cases. Also, of course,
you can try reducing the level of optimization.


Alternatively, the mere addition of "tem" changes the local memory use
of that function so that something that got clobbered before doesn't
get clobbered now.

The effect doesn't seem to be present on Intels:

> dfr<-do.call("data.frame",lapply(1:100,function(i)rnorm(100)))
> any(sapply(lapply(dfr,summary),is.null))
[1] FALSE

My mistake, but also a bug.
I did not open a device and called strheight("X").
==> R crashed

...\rgui --vanilla

Error in strwidth("X") : plot.new has not been called yet
(OK.)

R crashed.
(Happens also on Solaris.)

Fixed for R1.1: we weren't checking that the device existed.

Dear R-core,
Thank you for your great effort! I am finalising a bundle that works both in
R and Splus. But I faced the following minor problems with R CMD under both
UNIX and LINUX.
1. R CMD build denies to work with bundles. It reports
* checking `DESCRIPTION' package entry ... ERROR: no package entry in 
`DESCRIPTION'
Surely, there is no one, but there is Contains entry.
Next, according to R-exts manual, the packages contained in the bundle need
not contain DESCRIPTION but DESCRIPTION.in file. So building individual bundle 
packages with R CMD does not work neither:
* checking for `DESCRIPTION' ... ERROR: file `DESCRIPTION' not found           

This does not prevent from installing the bundle, and surprisingly enough, 
DESCRIPTION file appears afterwards in all bundle packages! So building 
individual packages now become available (!?)
2. Writing Rd-documentation is much easier than nroff files. But as the 
packages are also working in Splus, I need to generate .d-files as well.
I tried the command below in R-1.0.0 and development version R-1.1 both under 
UNIX and LINUX and get the following error:
sherna man/ % R CMD Rdconv --type=Sd plot.mefista.Rd > plot.mefista.d
Undefined subroutine &main::text2nroff called at /auto/local/pkg/R-1.0.0/instal
l.stams/lib/R/etc/Rdconvlib.pl line 1412, <rdfile> chunk 33.
It would also be nice just to be able to type R CMD Rd2Sd ;-)
Waiting for your reaction.
Best wishes,
Sergei

Yes, no one said it would work with a bundle, did they?  (See
R CMD build --help.)

You can use it to help check packages within a bundle (you can then
ignore that message) and build the bundle by hand.

Now people other than me are building bundles, to make it work with
bundles is on the TODO list.

Hmm. Doesn't happen here. (BTW: Remember to include as much
information about your system as you can think of. It's not obvious
whether you're running RedHat or SuSE for instance and in what
version.)

This would seem to be the problem: the dynamic library isn't there.
Did you get any error messages while compiling the package? (Except
for "...might be used uninitialized..." of which there are quite a few
here too).

Oh. Didn't see that. Then that part is OK. Sorry.

Hmmm. Interesting: I can provoke the crash on *my other* RedHat6.2

Looks like it is happening during the dynamic linking itself. Doesn't
look nice. (But installing gcc 2.95.2 might fix your problem.)

Conversion to Sd has never been very good.  As you see, it has been
inadvertently removed together with nroff support.  I have put it back
for 1.1, but do not expect it to be 100% correct and we do not plan to
continue to support nroff-based methods.


[BTW, your example lacks any keywords.]

Subject: Maths in R documentation

The document R-exts contains the following example of using 
mathematics in R documentation.

\deqn{p(x) = {\lambda^x\ \frac{e^{-\lambda}}{x!}}
     {p(x) = lambda^x exp(-lambda)/x!}

There is a syntax error in there, but that's not my point.
The problem is that using "R CMD Rd2dvi" I find that putting
the alternate forms of the equation on top of each other doesn't
work.

\deqn{foo}
     {bar}

is interpreted as

\deqn{foo}
bar

which causes a number of problems,e.g. you get both forms of the
equation printed, LaTeX complains about missing math delimiters, etc.
I solved this by putting everything on one line:

\deqn{foo}{bar}

but there is either a documentation error in there, or a problem with
parsing ".Rd" format files.

Another problem is that when I type "R CMD Rd2dvi coda" to get a printable
reference for all the functions in the coda package, they seem to come out in
a more or less random order. I get
read.bugs, mcmc, plot.mcmc, codamenu, read.and.check,...
I was expecting alphabetical order. What do I have to do to get this?

yes.

The typo is simply a missing "%" at the end of the first line
(which once was there, and "of course" was dropped when that documentation
 was translated from latex to texinfo ...)

The following is correct

 \deqn{foo}%
      {bar}

(see e.g. src/library/base/man/Special.Rd or ...../symnum.Rd )

I'll fix R-exts.texi.

The change just been proposed yesterday by Doug Bates:

Replace in R..../bin/Rd2dvi , about line 88

	files=`find ${dir} -name "*.[Rr]d" -print`
by
	files=`find ${dir} -name "*.[Rr]d" -print | sort`

Message-Id: <E12h99j-0000fN-00@harris.cc.strath.ac.uk>

Dear R-core team,
I came across the following bug (feature?):
Modyfying example from help(na.omit):
> ( m<-matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 0, 10, NA),ncol=2) )
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    0
[2,]    2   10
[3,]    3   NA
> ( mo<- na.omit(m) )
     [,1] [,2]
attr(,"na.action")
[1] 1
attr(,"na.action")attr(,"class")
[1] "omit"  
> dim(mo)
[1] 0 2        
> is.matrix(mo)
[1] TRUE                                                                       

So the result is an empty matrix! On the other hand   
> na.omit(as.data.frame(m))
  V1 V2
1  1  0
2  2 10                                                                        


works fine. help(na.omit) does not say that matrix is not a valid argument. At 
least in na.omit in Splus it is valid.
I have tested this in R-1.0.0 and development version R-1.1 under LINUX, 
Solaris and MSWindows.

Best wishes,
Sergei
