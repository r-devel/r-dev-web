Dear R developers,

first of all let me join the chorus of congratulations for the release
of R 1.0.0.  Well, done!

Unfortunately, I find it necessary to e-mail in a bug report regarding
the `nlme' package.  On my office machine I experience the following
trouble:

bossiaea:/opt/R$ R CMD check -c nlme 
Checking package `nlme' ...
 Massaging examples into `nlme-Ex.R' ...
 Running examples in package `nlme' ...
 ERROR

The end of nlme-Ex.Rout is:

(R CMD check MASS is also failing on an example that uses update.gls.)

On my machine at home I run into troubles even faster when running `R
CMD check nlme'.  One of the early examples chokes on the line:
> data(Orthodont)

I had done a "clean install" on that machine, i.e., I first blew away
the older installation of R.  It seems that the datasets Orthodont and
Pixel have been distributed with the nls library in earlier R versions
but not so in R 1.0.0.  But they are not distributed with the current
version of nlme either.

Cheers,

        Berwin

Subject: persp box occlusion bug

Full_Name: Bill Simpson
Version: 64.1
OS: linux
Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


Bug in persp() bounding box:
If the surface being plotted extends below the lower z-axis boundary, the box
is
drawn with the wrong occlusion. The box is shown as being occluded by the
surface
even though it should be in front of the surface.

The box is correct for surface extending above the box. Problem is only for
surface extending below the box.

This exhibits the bug:

std<-rep(seq(-32,32,8),9)/1000 * 60
cf<-rep(seq(-32,32,8),rep(9,9))/1000 *60 
dp<-(cf-std)/.6
std<-unique(std)
cf<-unique(cf)
dp<-t(matrix(dp,length(cf),length(std)))

Just to get these issues recorded in the bug repository:

a) We don't handle multiple window closes well

My "favourite" version of this is when I ^Z out of an R session with
an open graphics window to do something on the command line, then kill
the graphics window (which does nothing), kill it again, realise that
it's because the R session was stopped, and:

[pd@blueberry BUILD]$ %
bin/R
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

b) X11 errors should be caught by an error handler, not kill R.

This is mainly seen when there's an error somewhere else, such as
trouble with the font setup. But in principle, we should at worst shut
down the graphics window, not R itself.

Subject:  graphics bugs: steep slopes and large values beyond ylim 
Cc: ben@bolker-nt.zoo.ufl.edu


  Some of my students have uncovered some apparent graphics bugs in 
R.  I think they may manifest slightly different on different platforms/
with different display devices (they sometimes report a Windows graph
that looks OK but odd results on printing).
  I'm able to replicate similar problems on my Linux (RH 6.0) system.


1. abline() plots nothing, or a wrong line, when the slope is too steep.

plot(0:10,0:10)
abline(a=0,b=100)
abline(a=0,b=200)
abline(a=0,b=300)
abline(a=0,b=80)

2. when plotting with type "l" and with values far beyond the limits of
the plot, semi-random lines appear on the plot.

plot(exp(1:100),ylim=c(0,10),type="l")

Any thoughts?  I poked a little bit at this myself: abline calls GLine, neither of them
seems to do much checking whether the endpoints of the line to be drawn are way outside of the
window (I guess that XDrawLine, which gets called by GLine, can't handle this).
I guess this should probably be fixed at the the level of GLine (it might fix both of
the above problems, but I'm a little bit afraid digging this deeply into the graphics drivers.
  Maybe it will be obvious to someone closer to the code?

Submission from: (NULL) (141.30.125.20)


I autoconfigured/configured the src'es w/o having XDR (#undef HAVE_RPC_XDR_H).

In saveload.c , at the beginning of the file the XDR code is enclosed by
matching #ifdefs.

But in the NEW_SAVE_FORMAT section, there are no #ifdefs around the XDR code.

Does this imply that using the new save format requires using XDR or is 
this simply an oversight?

The defines in R_SaveToFile and R_LoadFromFile determine what is 
actually used.  I think all that happens is that unused code is not
excluded from the compile (and that happens with the BinarySave code
if XDR is available).

Submission from: (NULL) (193.62.250.209)


I reported this on r-help, but here is official bug report.

The present convolve() does not do convolution by default. Its default behaviour
is
correlation. This is a bug.

The default argument conj should be set to FALSE.

The zero-padding should be on the right for linear convolution (don't ask me
why you call this type="open"; I suggest type="linear").

Here is what I expect linear convolution to do:
myconvolve<-function (x,h) 
{
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    #zero pad
    if(nx>nh)
       {
       x <- c(x,rep(0, nh-1))
       h<-c(h,rep(0,nx-1))
       }
    else
       {
       h <- c(h,rep(0, nx-1))
       x<-c(x,rep(0,nh-1))
       }
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/length(x)
#I am not sure about this, the R IFFT is weird
}

What "circular" convolution should do is just
eliminate the zero-padding:

myconvolve2<-function (x,h)
{
#no padding, circular convolution
    nx <- length(x)
    nh <- length(h)
    x <- fft(fft(x) * fft(h), inv = TRUE)
    Re(x)/(nx)
}


I suggest that you create two functions, convolve() and correlate(), and get
rid
of the conj argument in convolve().

Call objects don't always behave as you'd expect. They're mostly
list-like, but with exceptions:

> f<-function(x,y,...)match.call(expand.dots=FALSE)
> xx <- f(y=1,2,z=3,4)
> dd <- xx$...
> xx$... <- NULL
> c(xx,dd)
[[1]]
f(x = 2, y = 1)

$z
[1] 3

[[3]]
[1] 4

> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, z = 3, 4)

(Splus has this rather differently, since dd becomes a call to list()
rather than a list of promises:

S> c(xx,dd)
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)
S> as.call(c(as.list(xx),dd))
f(x = 2, y = 1, list, z = 3, 4)

...but at least gives the same in both cases)

Also, the names of arguments added with [[<- is getting dropped if a
new element is required:

S has what I'd expect there:

S> xx[["abc"]]<-123
S> xx
f(x = 2, y = 1, abc = 123)

(It's not too high priority to fix, but confusing data.entry and
dataentry provokes this quite easily.)

There's a not-so-short  "stop.list" of functions which are *NOT* tested for
segfaults.   dataentry (w/ and w/o ".") is among them.
all the interactive ones are, actually.
[[remember:   The list was quite a bit shorter, and there were R core
	      members who complained...]] 

Look in  ..../tests/make-no-segfault.R for the statements starting with

 edit.int <- c("fix", "edit", "vi", "emacs", "pico", "xemacs", "xedit")
 misc.int <- c("browser", "bug.report", "menu")
 stop.list[["base"]] <-
    ..

to find all the functions which are *not* tested for seg.faults.

Maybe we (R-core) we should really always have
      R_TESTLOTS=yes
in our environments?

Actually, I'd prefer having some means of markup in the Rd source code
to indicate whether an object should not be employed for the no-segfault
testing.  We could still keep the R_TESTLOTS, though ...

E.g, the socket docs would have something correspding to \dontrun in the
examples section.

This should be cleaner than having to change the script in tests.

(Confusion arose when Fritz added old.packages() two days ago ...)

MIME-Version: 1.0

I'm having sporadic problems with glm on my alpha workstation running
Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.0 (I can't replicate the problem on my Linux PC). I
have the same problem whether I use a version of R built with the native
C-compiler or a version compiled with gcc. In both cases I've built with
g77.

I want to do some simulations with a call to glm in each rep. A simplified
version would be something like:

N_100; NREPS_100; lam.e_5; logit.inv_function(x){ exp(x)/(1+exp(x)) }
for(i in (1:NREPS)) {
   cat(paste("REP",i,"\n"))
   T_rexp(N,(lam.e))
   Delta_rbinom(N,1,logit.inv(1+T))
   ff_glm(Delta ~ T,family=binomial(logit))
}
 
It often completes all reps, but I occasionally get errors related to
lengths of various objects, etc.:

REP 1 
REP 2
<snip>
REP 9 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : variable lengths differ


REP 1 
<snip>
REP 53 
Error: subscript out of bounds

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 41 
Error in model.matrix(t, data) : invalid variable type

Different error messages, different numbers of reps. When I call glm again
using the values of T and Delta just before the error, it runs error-free.
When I put the data in a data frame before calling glm I can also get
messages like:

REP 1 
<snip>
REP 64 
Error in model.frame(formula, rownames, variables, varnames, extras, extranames,  : 
        invalid variable type

I just did the above ~10 times on i386 and nothing happened. We've had
previous reports on trouble in the lm/glm/model.matrix etc. region on
Alpha. 

If you compile with all warnings on, are you getting warnings on
pointer/integer comparisons or assignments?

Can you create a reproducible case (with set.seed to keep the random
generator sequence constant) and would you know how run a debugger on
your version so that we can figure out what is going wrong?

I'll see what I can do about getting a more reproducible error. 

Any tips on what to look for if I'm running R within GDB? I don't have
much experience with the debugger. I mostly just use it to see where my
programs are dying. But R is not -- it just gives strange error messages.

TIA,
Brad

(Two suggestions which are in the current snapshot follow. Looks like
what is which header varies a bit.)

Add a line (third one here) to src/include/R_ext/RS.h:

#ifndef R_RS_H
#define R_RS_H

#include <string.h> /* for memcpy */
#include "Rconfig.h" /* for F77_SYMBOL */

Those are all normal.

That looks like a regex bug, with a why? comment in the code. Change
(int) to (long), twice.

I've never seen those, but try adding

#define STDC_HEADERS 1

at the top of regex.c.  (I am not convinced that is the cause here.)

Normal, on a platform with xdr.

One technique is to set a breakpoint at the line that displays the
error, then you can inspect the condition that caused it (you may have
to go "up" a couple of times to get into an interesting environment.)

Sometimes, it turns out that a variable contains something that it
shouldn't due to memory corruption and then you may have to set a
breakpoint earlier in the code and then maybe a watchpoint on the
memory location.

Another thing that is useful even without gdb is to investigate the
output of traceback() and maybe set 

options(error=quote(DUMP <<- sys.status()))

which allows you to subsequently investigate any active environment at
the time of the error, e.g. using ls(envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]), and
get("x",envir=DUMP$sys.frames[[3]]).

(Newer snapshots have a more elaborate dump.frames function, but the
above should do).

I looked into the glm problem some more. Seems to be a memory problem that
occurs just after garbage collection. The easiest way for me to
reproduce  the error is in lapply. I take a list and ask lapply to provide
the descriptive stat summary. I do this several times with the same list.
Most often it gives the correct summary, but just after allocSExp calls
R_gc, one of the summaries for a list element will be NULL. 

E.g for a data frame dat with five columns I get the following (having added
print statements in summary.default and in allocSExp just after the test
for whether gc is necessary):

> lapply(as.list(dat), summary, maxsum = maxsum)
[1] "exiting summary.default"
R_FreeSEXP == NULL  
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"
[1] "exiting summary.default"

I don't know if the following is relevant, but for some reason I've found 
I can avoid this particular problem if I make a small change in lapply in 
its main loop.  Around line 50 of apply.c:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = eval(R_fcall, rho);
    }

if I change it to make an assignment to a
temporary variable first everything seems to work fine:

    PROTECT(ans = allocVector(VECSXP, n));
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        INTEGER(ind)[0] = i + 1;
        tem = eval(R_fcall, rho);
        VECTOR(ans)[i] = tem;
    }

hasn't given me any NULLs yet.

Now that is pretty darn odd... Looks quite a bit like a compiler bug.
Those two pieces of code should be equivalent as far as I can see.

One thing that you might do: objdump -dS apply.o allows you to see
what code the compiler generates for the two cases. Also, of course,
you can try reducing the level of optimization.


Alternatively, the mere addition of "tem" changes the local memory use
of that function so that something that got clobbered before doesn't
get clobbered now.

The effect doesn't seem to be present on Intels:

> dfr<-do.call("data.frame",lapply(1:100,function(i)rnorm(100)))
> any(sapply(lapply(dfr,summary),is.null))
[1] FALSE

Here's the output in readable form. The bug seems to be that
count.fields() thinks the records are the same length but read.table
doesn't.

Ok. read.table and count.fields don't have identical defaults.

R> args(count.fields)
function (file, sep = "", quote = "", skip = 0)

R> args(read.table)
function (file, header = FALSE, sep = "", quote = "\"'", dec = ".",
    row.names, col.names, as.is = FALSE, na.strings = "NA", skip = 0)


So if count.fields likes your data but read.table doesn't, you probably
want

 read.table("Consult/krasdata",sep="\t",quote="")


Please don't use Base64 encoding in attached files -- it was quite hard to
find a program to decode it, and it's really intended for sending binary
files.  Use plain text, and if your mailer insists on encoding attachments
then just cut and paste the output into the message.

read.data and count.fields have different defaults for the quote=
argument (which is arguably a bug). Try read.table(...,quote="") if
the data contain quote marks (single or double).

Might it be possible to tighten the definition of "is.qr".  I
noticed that after I mistakenly typed

example(lm)  # make lm object named lm.D9
qr.Q(lm.D9)

which exhausted the heap memory and produced two warning
messages.  As an object of class "lm" has a "qr" component,
"is.qr" failed to detect that "lm.D9" was not a "qr" object.  The
obvious thing might be to tighten the definition of "is.qr",
perhaps

"is.qr" <-
function(x) all(c("qr", "rank", "qraux", "pivot") %in% names(x))

And may I add my congratulations to the core group.

Cheers, Jonathan.

indeed.
yes, it should be tightened.

    JonR> The obvious thing might be to tighten the definition of "is.qr",

    JonR> perhaps

    JonR> "is.qr" <- function(x) all(c("qr", "rank", "qraux", "pivot") %in%
    JonR> names(x))

Just checked: 
 S-plus 5.1 checks for  qr and qraux only (but not just for the presence of
 the names, also !is.null(.) as we now do for $qr.

It makes sense to have this a FAST function since it's called quite a few
times in some calculations... maybe change current
    is.qr <- function(x) is.null(x$qr)
to
    is.qr <- function(x) is.null(x$qr) && !is.null(x$rank) && !is.null(x$qraux)

The current behavior is "according to documentation" so that would have to
be updated as well.

    JonR> And may I add my congratulations to the core group.

Don't shure what I should think about it. 

my compiler is:

>gcc --version
2.95.2

R is compiled using the

"-fPIC -O3 -fstrict-aliasing -ffast-math -funroll-loops -mpentiumpro -march=pentiumpro -fschedule-insns2"

compiler switches. I used 

./configure --with-g77 --enable-blas_risc --enable-readline --with-x

for configuring.

I can't help noticing that you are configuring for a RISC optimized BLAS
library on an Intel x86 processor.  I have no idea if this is serious,
but it seems a bit odd.

Since this feature was added for PowerPC Linux distributions at my
request, I'll comment on this.  I would say that it is very unlikely to
be of any help, but it probably won't hurt.  The configure script will
check to see if libblas_risc can be located.  If it can't be found, it
won't be used.  Configure won't even look for it unless you request it
with --enable-blas_risc.

Furthermore, I don't believe that configure will actually use
libblas_risc unless you also --enable-blas.  I could be wrong in that
regard.  Using --enable-blas_risc could implicitly --enable-blas as
well. It's been many months since I wrote that configure option.  I do
know that configure will test if linking -lblas works first.  If that
fails, it won't even bother with -lblas_risc.  

Hope this helps,

That's a pretty heavy set of optimization options you're using there!

Basically, there are two possibilities:

1) You've triggered a compiler bug
2) You've triggered a bug in R

In either case, you'll have to dig deeper and see if you can catch the
exact spot where things go wrong. You might start R with the debugger,
run the base-Ex.R with it while having a breakpoint set at the error
message you are getting. But before that try running the example that
triggers the bug by itself and see if the bug is still tickled.

######################################################



I stumbled on this error while doing a classroom demonstration. The error is reproducible, 
but seems to require a specific sequence of operations: (1) fitting a linear model; (2) 
calling the summary function; (3) calling a function of mine, called test.terms; (4) making 
a typing error in a call to update -- typing "~.~" instead of ".~." . (5) After this, a 
correct call to update fails. If any of the steps 1-4 is omitted, everything proceeds 
normally.

I've attached the following: 

 o   several listings illustrating when the error occurs and when it does not; 

 o   a listing of the dataset; 

 o   a listing of the test.terms function and the functions that it uses. 

The dataset, though, seems unremarkable, and test.tests is a straightforward function 
without (intended) side effects. The library fox just contains some functions and datasets; 
I can, of course, supply it if that seems relevant.

I'm not sure that this is a bug in R, but it seemed worth reporting.

Thanks for your trouble,
 John

I think this is fixed now. Apparently model formulas like the above
caused R to become confused as to the number of variables in the
model and overrun the array of names, subsequently confusing the
garbage collector.

(Temporary workaround: Just don't do that...)

Uhm, why would you want to do that???

Have you tried building from a clean (fresh) source tree?

What on earth gives you the idea that that might work?? The configure
scripts have changed many a time since 0.65.0. Or was config.cache a
typo?

Subject: Printing graphs on W98 laptop

Full_Name: Peter Green
Version: 1.0.0 and 0.99.0
OS: windows 98
Submission from: (NULL) (194.83.240.36)


Running R (either 1.0.0 or 0.99.0) under Windows 98 on
my Toshiba laptop (Satellite 4080), I get a problem
when I hit the print toolbar button with the graph window on top.
It declares an illegal operation, and produces the error
messages reproduced below (slightly different in each
version). It then terminates R and returns to the desktop.

The printer is an HP 6MP, directly connected to the laptop,
no network.

All is fine on my desktop with Windows NT4.0.

Is this a known problem?

It's been reported before, but been unreproduceable for any of the
developers... I'm fairly sure this is the exact same spot that tripped
Bendix & coworkers. On their systems it appears to depend on the day
of the week and go away when the system adinistrators are looking!
Yours seems to be the first "plain" system (i.e. non-networked
printers) with the problem. Hmm... Are you any good with a debugger?
