Regular Rtools releases and updates
===================================

Regular releases and updates of Rtools are versioned by svn revisions.  To
get the source code, one just needs to check out that specific revision of
ucrt3.

Correction: Rtools43 release 5863 to Rtools44 release 6459 use a patch for
tktable to allow building on aarch64.  Due to an error, the patch is not in
the respective svn versions, but has been added in 6461.  To build
tcl_bundle for the mentioned released, tktable.diff has to be added manually
from svn revision 6461.

Maintenance Rtools updates
==========================

Maintenance updates are created for frozen series of Rtools in exceptional
circumstances, such as to fix a security vulnerability.  To get the source
code, one needs to check out a base revision (typically the last regular
update of that Rtools series), and apply to it a patch stored in this
directory.  For example, file 5976_5975.diff is a patch to get maintenance
version 5976 from a regular version 5975.  5976 is a maintenance update of
Rtools43.

To find out which update is a maintenance update, refer to the corresponding
NEWS file for Rtools.
