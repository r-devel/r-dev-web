<h1 class="title">Howto: Building R-devel and packages on Windows</h1>
<p class="author">Tomas Kalibera</p>
</header>
<p>This document is written as a tutorial intended to be read from the
beginning until reaching the point with the required information.
Users only needing to build existing packages from source will
need to read only the first two sections.</p>
<p>This documentation is for R-devel (to become R 4.5.0).</p>
<h2 id="external-software-for-building-from-source">External software for building from source</h2>
<p>MikTeX (with basic packages and <code>inconsolata</code>) is needed to build
package vignettes and documentation. Inno Setup is needed to build the
R installer.</p>
<p>Not needed for the “recommended” packages, but some other contributed
CRAN R packages may require additional external software to install or
for the checks (more below).</p>
<h2 id="installing-rtools44">Installing Rtools44</h2>
<p>R and packages are built using Rtools, which is a collection of build
tools, a compiler toolchain, headers and pre-compiled static libraries.</p>
<p>R-devel currently uses Rtools44 (with pre-release builds available
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/">here</a>), where the build
tools are from Msys2 and QPDF. The compiler toolchain, headers and
pre-compiled static libraries are built using MXE. Rtools44 is available
via a standalone offline installer which contains all of these components
and is available from
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a>, as a
file named like <code>rtools44-6094-6039.exe</code>, where <code>6094-6039</code> are version
numbers.</p>
<p>The installer has currently around 450MB in size and about 3GB will be used
after installation. It includes libraries needed by almost all CRAN
packages, so that such libraries don’t have to and shouldn’t be downloaded
from external sources (the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html">CRAN Repository
Policy</a> has details
on requirements on CRAN).</p>
<p>The advantage is that this way it is easy to ensure that the toolchain and
the libraries are always compatible, and to upgrade the toolchain and all
libraries together.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the defaults and install into <code>c:/rtools44</code>. When
done that way, Rtools44 may be used in the same R session which installed
it or which was started before Rtools44 was installed.</p>
<p>From the user perspective, Rtools44 is not different from Rtools43, it only
has newer version of compilers and other software. The only big difference
is that in addition to the version for 64-bit Intel processors, there is
also a version for 64-bit ARM processors. Both versions work the same way
from the user’s perspective, the key difference is that they use different
compiler toolchains (GCC with binutils vs LLVM) and indeed the distribution
file names are different.</p>
<p>R-devel (to become R 4.5.0) initially uses Rtools44, but may be switched to
a later version of Rtools before the release of R 4.5.0.</p>
<p>Rtools44 (for Intel) is best tested on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2022.
It is sometimes tested on Windows 11 and expected to work there well because
of Windows backward compatibility. Rtools 4.4 might also work on older
systems, but it is minimally tested: Rtools 4.4 was tested before the
release of R 4.4.0 and could build R from source also on Windows 7 and
Windows 8.1. However, Msys2 officially does not support Windows 7 anymore:
the build tools may not work properly. Some important libraries included in
Rtools 4.4, including ICU, require at least Windows 7, and hence code built
by Rtools 4.4 cannot be expected to work reliably on Windows older than 7.</p>
<p>Rtools44 for ARM is only tested on Windows 11. Windows 10 is not supported:
while it already had support for 64-bit ARM CPUs, it could not run 64-bit
Intel binaries, which are used in Rtools. So far, the testing of Rtools for
ARM has been limited and the LLVM (flang-new) Fortran compiler is still not
stable enough to compile some presumably valid Fortran code in CRAN
packages. Also, some features are not supported (e.g. MPI). However,
Rtools for ARM should already allow package authors of most packages to test
their code and adapt it to work on the platform. Rtools for ARM can only be
installed on a 64-bit ARM machine. Rtools for Intel can also be installed
on a 64-bit Intel machine and can coexist with the version for ARM.</p>
<h2 id="building-packages-from-source-using-rtools44">Building packages from source using Rtools44</h2>
<p>One only needs to install the R build (via the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html">installer</a>)
and Rtools44 (as described above), in either order.</p>
<p>No further set up is needed to e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;PKI&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>which will build from source <code>PKI</code> and its dependency <code>base64enc</code>.</p>
<p>As a harder and longer test, let’s try installing <code>RcppCWB</code> from github.</p>
<p>First, install <code>devtools</code> (accept to build packages from source when
offered, but most needed packages will be installed as binary):</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(devtools)</code></pre>
<p>And then install <code>RcppCWB</code> from github as source:</p>
<pre><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;PolMine/RcppCWB&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let’s check installing package <code>tiff</code>:</p>
<pre><code>download.packages(&quot;tiff&quot;, destdir=&quot;.&quot;)
tools::Rcmd(&quot;check tiff_0.1-11.tar.gz&quot;) # update file name as needed</code></pre>
<p>One can run the package check also from command-line, e.g. cmd.exe, as
usual. No setting of PATH is necessary, Rtools44 will be found
automatically by R.</p>
<p>R since version 4.2 on Windows uses UCRT as the C runtime and all native
code is built for this runtime. It is not possible to use static libraries
compiled by Rtools40 and earlier, which were built for MSVCRT, an older C
runtime for Windows. UCRT allows UTF-8 to be used as the native encoding.</p>
<h2 id="building-r-from-source-using-rtools44">Building R from source using Rtools44</h2>
<p>One may run the Msys2 shell (“Rtools bash” from the startup menu, or run
<code>c:/rtools44/msys2.exe</code> and run R from there). One may also install
additional Msys2 software using <code>pacman</code>, e.g. additional build tools.</p>
<p>Run the Msys2 shell, update the Msys2 part and install two more package:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Syuu
pacman -Sy wget subversion</code></pre>
<p>These pacman commands may also be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Install an index of available files using <code>pacman -Fy</code> and then get e.g. 
a package providing file <code>unzip.exe</code> by <code>pacman -F unzip.exe</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>List all available packages (not necessarily installed) using <code>pacman -Sl</code>. List installed packages using <code>pacman -Q</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One should only be installing packages from “msys” sub-repository of Msys2,
mixing other sub-repositories with the toolchain may cause trouble.</p>
<p>Like earlier versions of Rtools, but unlike Msys2 default, the home
directory in <code>bash</code> is the user profile (e.g. <code>C:\Users\username</code>).</p>
<p>As a next step to install R from source, download and unpack the Tcl/Tk bundle
from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a>, a file
named such as <code>tcltk-6094-5412.zip</code>, then download the R sources.</p>
<pre><code>TCLBUNDLE=tcltk-6094-5412.zip
wget https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/$TCLBUNDLE

svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk

cd trunk
unzip ../$TCLBUNDLE

cd src/gnuwin32</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding version of the bundle for ARM would be named
<code>tcltk-6094-5412-aarch64.zip</code>.</p>
<p>To automatically download always the current/latest version of the Tcl
bundle, one can do e.g. this:</p>
<pre><code>wget -np -nd -r -l1 -A &#39;tcltk-*.zip&#39; https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/</code></pre>
<p>And a similar trick can be used to obtain other files that always exist but
have changing version names.</p>
<p>Set environment variables as follows (update the MiKTeX installation
directory in the commands below if needed, this one is “non-standard” from
an automated installation described later below):</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
export TAR=&quot;/usr/bin/tar&quot;
export TAR_OPTIONS=&quot;--force-local&quot;</code></pre>
<p>On ARM, the corresponding bin directory for the toolchain would be
<code>aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin</code> (instead of
<code>x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin</code>).</p>
<p>Test that the tools are available by running</p>
<pre><code>which make gcc pdflatex tar</code></pre>
<p>Note: GNU <code>tar</code>, which is part of Rtools44, does not work with colons used
in drive letters on Windows paths, because it instead uses colons when
specifying non-local archives. By adding <code>--force-local</code> to <code>TAR_OPTIONS</code>,
this is disabled and colons work for drive letters. One can, instead, use
the Windows tar (a variant of BSD tar) on Windows 10 and newer, e.g. 
<code>/c/Windows/System32/tar</code>, but several CRAN packages rely on GNU tar
features particularly during installation. Rtools40 and earlier used a
customized version of GNU tar, which did not need the <code>--force-local</code>
options for drive letters to work.</p>
<p><code>MkRules.rules</code> expects Inno Setup in <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6</code>.
If you have installed it into a different directory, specify it in
<code>MkRules.local</code>, as shown here:</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;MkRules.local
ISDIR = C:/Program Files (x86)/InnoSetup
EOF</code></pre>
<p>On ARM, add these two additional lines to <code>MkRules.local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>USE_LLVM = 1
WIN =</code></pre>
<p>Build R and the recommended packages:</p>
<pre><code>make rsync-recommended
make all recommended</code></pre>
<p>When the build succeeds, one can run R via <code>../../bin/R</code>.</p>
<p>To build the installer, run <code>make distribution</code>, it will appear in
<code>installer/R-devel-win.exe</code>. Note, that while one may use parallel make via
<code>-j</code> for <code>all</code> and <code>recommended</code>, intermittent problems have been seen while
building the manual, so the build may fail and one may have to finish with a
serial build. Parallel make is not useful for <code>distribution</code>, because of
issues with building the manual in parallel.</p>
<p>To build R with debug symbols, set <code>export DEBUG=T</code> in the terminal before
the build (and possibly add `EOPTS = -O0” to MkRules.local to disable
compiler optimizations, hence obtaining more reliable debug information).</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-rtools44">Upgrading Rtools44</h2>
<p>Please note that when Rtools44 is uninstalled, one loses also the Msys2
packages installed there in addition to the default set (or any other
possibly accidentally added files to the installation directory, so to
<code>c:\rtools44</code> by default). On ARM, the default is <code>c:\rtools44-aarch64</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of installing Rtools44 (via the installer), one might use a
standalone installation of Msys2 and use the toolchain from the tarball (as
described later in the text).</p>
<p>Also, one may upgrade the Msys2 part of Rtools44 by <code>pacman</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Syuu</code></pre>
<p>The toolchain and libraries in Rtools44 can be upgraded from the Rtools44
Msys2 bash. The toolchain and libraries are inside
<code>/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> (which corresponds to
<code>c:\rtools44\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> outside the shell).</p>
<p>To find what is the current installed version, run</p>
<pre><code>cat /x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/.version</code></pre>
<p>You will get a single number, such as <code>6094</code>, which corresponds to the
number in the toolchain tarball name, e.g. 
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst</code>. So all that is needed is to
delete the directory, download the current full toolchain tarball from
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a> and
extract it. This can be done from the shell using commands like</p>
<pre><code>cd /
wget https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst
rm -rf /x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix
tar xf rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst
rm rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst</code></pre>
<p>After upgrading, it is recommended to update also the version number in
<code>.version</code>.</p>
<p>In Rtools44, this version is also stored in the Windows registry and is
displayed in <code>Add/Remove Programs</code> menu and used by some tools, including
<code>winget</code> (see the output of <code>winget list</code>). To display the stored version
number from the cmd.exe command line, run</p>
<pre><code>reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Rtools44_is1 /v DisplayVersion
reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Rtools44_is1 /v DisplayName</code></pre>
<p>(in a non-standard installation of Rtools44, the information may be stored
elsewhere, e.g. in an installation for the current user only, it would be
under <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> instead of <code>HKLM</code>)</p>
<p>For Rtools44, the version would be prefixed by <code>4.4.</code>, so it would be
something like <code>4.4.6094</code> and the name would be something like <code>Rtools 4.4 (6094-6039)</code>. The second number, <code>6039</code> in the example, is the version of
scripts used to build the Rtools44 installer.</p>
<p>To update the version information after upgrading Rtools44 toolchain and
libraries manually to version <code>6094</code>, run (keep <code>6039</code> alone as this is not
related to the installer):</p>
<pre><code>reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Rtools44_is1 /v DisplayVersion /d 4.4.6094 /f
reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Rtools44_is1 /v DisplayName /d &quot;Rtools 4.4 (6094-6039)&quot; /f</code></pre>
<p>The version of Rtools44 for ARM is from the Windows viewpoint a different
application and can coexist with an installation of Rtools for Intel. The
ARM version installs by default into <code>c:\rtools44-aarch64</code>, the toolchain
and libraries are in <code>aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>, the registry key is
<code>Rtools44-aarch64_is1</code> and the display name is e.g. <code>Rtools 4.4 (6094-6039-aarch64)</code>. The corresponding toolchain bundle name is
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-aarch64-6094.tar.zst</code>. The commands above
thus have to be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>For reference, one may find out exactly how a given version of the toolchain
was built by checking out</p>
<pre><code>svn checkout -r 6094 https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/mxe/</code></pre>
<p>The version numbers, download URLs for the sources, and build configurations
are under “src” (not all of those packages are part of the toolchain). So
e.g. to find out how <code>tiff</code> was built, one may run</p>
<pre><code>svn cat -r 6094 https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/mxe/src/tiff.mk</code></pre>
<p>This is one way to quickly find out if an upgrade would provide a newer
version of a specific library.</p>
<p>An upgrade “to fix things, without knowing for sure it will help” may be
useful when one is building someone else’s source packages (so not from
CRAN, where binary packages are provided, but say from github) and the
package doesn’t build due to say linking errors, but it builds correctly
somewhere else (say via github actions on the package github page). One
might also try on Winbuilder. When such package is building on Winbuilder
or via github actions fine, but locally has linking errors, it may be that
an upgrade could help.</p>
<p>In other cases, a package author working on their own package would probably
know for sure that an upgrade is needed, e.g. when local installation of
Rtools44 does not have a library which was however already added to
Rtools44. Upgrading in other cases would likely be a waste of time and
resources.</p>
<h2 id="co-existence-of-different-rtools-and-r-versions">Co-existence of different Rtools and R versions</h2>
<p>Package authors may prefer to have both Rtools43 and Rtools44 (or possibly
Rtools42 or Rtools40) installed in their system. This is possible, these
are treated as different applications by Windows and are installed in
different directories (by default <code>c:\rtools43</code> and <code>c:\rtools44</code>). It
means one would have duplicate installations of Msys2 (which are included in
both), so there would be different sets of Msys2 packages and different
versions in the two corresponding “Rtools” Msys2 shells. The home directory
as perceived by the shells will be the same (the user profile), which may be
a good thing, yet, there are potential issues with configurations of some of
the tools, if they have different versions. That would be easiest to solve
by upgrading the Msys2 packages in both installations of Rtools.</p>
<p>Care must be taken not to mix multiple installations of Msys2 environments.
To reduce the risk, it is recommended to refrain from including an Msys2
installation to user/system <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p>One needs to be careful with third party tools for installing software on
Windows, such as <code>winget</code>, when using multiple installations of Rtools:
these tools may offer to upgrade say <code>Rtools43</code> by <code>Rtools44</code>, which would
not be desirable in such case.</p>
<p>R version 4.1 and 4.0 would automatically use Rtools40 as documented for
those versions (with the necessity to put the build tools on PATH, as
documented). R 4.2 automatically uses Rtools42, R 4.3 automatically uses
Rtools43, and R-devel now uses Rtools44.</p>
<p>Note that mixing build tools from different versions of Msys2 may not work
due to incompatibilities in the Cygwin/Msys runtime in those versions (this
is also the case of Git for Windows). It is not a good idea to put tools
from different versions on PATH, nor to use Msys2 bash tools from a
different installation.</p>
<p>However, the toolchain and libraries themselves
(<code>c:\rtools44\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> in Rtools44,
<code>c:\rtools43\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> in Rtools43,
<code>c:\rtools42\x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> in Rtools42 or
<code>c:\rtools40\mingw64</code> in Rtools40) do not link to the Cygwin/Msys runtime
and hence can be used from an external Msys2 installation. Please note that
the delineation of what is a build tool and what is inside the toolchain and
libraries part is not always clear and may change over time, depending on
how it is easiest to build the tool, but, nothing from
<code>x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> needs the Cygwin/Msys runtime.</p>
<p>The ARM and Intel version of Rtools44 may be installed on the same 64-bit
ARM machine. The Intel version would be used with an Intel version of R
(running in emulator on the machine, but that is done automatically by the
OS) and the ARM version would be used with an ARM version of R.</p>
<h2 id="installing-software-for-building-using-a-toolchain-tarball">Installing software for building using a toolchain tarball</h2>
<p>Alternatively to Rtools44 install from the installer, one may use custom
build tools (e.g. a standalone version of Msys2) with a “toolchain tarball”
consisting only of the compiler toolchain, headers and pre-compiled static
libraries. This is useful for server and expert use.</p>
<p>The “base” version of the toolchain tarball contains the compiler toolchain
and libraries needed to build R itself, including the recommended packages,
but it is enough for most CRAN packages. The “full” version
contains libraries for almost all CRAN packages.</p>
<p>The tarballs do not include Msys2. One instead needs to have a separate
installation of the required build tools, typically a standalone
installation of Msys2. This text assumes a standalone Msys2 installation at
least with packages <code>unzip diffutils make winpty rsync texinfo tar texinfo-tex zip subversion bison moreutils xz patch</code>.</p>
<p>The tarballs are more flexible in that one does not need to always install
Msys2 nor the full set of libraries. Also, tarballs are compressed using
the Zstandard compressor, which works better for this content than the
compressor used by Rtools44 (InnoSetup does not support Zstandard as of this
writing), so the compressed file is smaller and decompresses faster.</p>
<p>One can also use a single Msys2 installation with the build tools for both
Intel and ARM tarballs (on an ARM machine).</p>
<p>The script below automatically installs Msys2, MiKTeX, Inno Setup and 64-bit
Ghostscript (the last three into non-standard directories) and can be used
on fresh systems or virtual machines or containers without previous
installation of this software. It could also be used as an inspiration for
installing on real systems, but one should review it first or run selected
lines manually, to prevent damage to the existing installations:</p>
<pre><code>cd \
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r/setup.ps1 -OutFile setup.ps1 -UseBasicParsing
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1</code></pre>
<p>One may also want to clean up after the script (<code>temp</code> can be deleted).</p>
<h2 id="additional-external-software-for-building-and-checking-from-source">Additional external software for building and checking from source</h2>
<p>Additional software is needed by some contributed CRAN packages, including
Pandoc, 32-bit Ghostscript, JDK, JAGS, MSMPI, PhantomJS, Python, Git, Ruby
and Rust executables. A script is
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/setup_checks.ps1">available</a>
to install these automatically on a new system, following the <code>setup.ps1</code>
script mentioned earlier. These scripts are regularly used in a setup for
testing newer versions of Rtools (named “ucrt3”) currently based on
Rtools44, but with pre-downloaded installers, so it may be necessary to
update them for newer versions when the older installers become
inaccessible.</p>
<p>On 64-bit ARM machines, the scripts install 64-bit ARM builds of the
software when available (currently only Python), otherwise they install the
64-bit Intel builds. However, it is not possible to link Intel DLLs to an
ARM executable, so DLLs from 64-bit Intel builds cannot be used.</p>
<h2 id="building-packages-from-source-using-the-toolchain-tarball">Building packages from source using the toolchain tarball</h2>
<p>This section assumes that R has been installed from its binary
installer.</p>
<p>First, download the toolchain and libraries. They are available in a single
tarball
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a>, a
file named such as <code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst</code> (6094 is the
version number). The “base” toolchain is named
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-base-6094.tar.zst</code>. The corresponding versions for
ARM would be named <code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-aarch64-6094.tar.zst</code> and
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-base-aarch64-6094.tar.zst</code></p>
<p>You may run an Msys2 shell <code>C:\msys64\msys2.exe</code> and the following commands
(please note the number 6094 in this example needs to be replaced by the
current release available, there is always only one at a time):</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ucrt3
cd ucrt3
wget https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst
tar xf rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst

export R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT=`pwd`/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix
export R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_PATH=`pwd`/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin:/usr/bin
export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
export TAR=&quot;/usr/bin/tar&quot;
export TAR_OPTIONS=&quot;--force-local&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding version of the tarball for ARM would be named
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-aarch64-6094.tar.zst</code> and the corresponding
location of the toolchain is <code>aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>.</p>
<p>To make the use of Rtools44 simpler, when R is installed via the binary
installer it by default uses Rtools44 for the compilers and libraries.
<code>PATH</code> will be set by R (inside front-ends like RGui and RTerm, but also R
CMD) to include the build tools (e.g. make) and the compilers (e.g. gcc).
In addition, R installed via the binary installer will automatically set
<code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> (and <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> for backwards compatibility) to the
Rtools44 location for building R packages. This feature is only present in
the installer builds of R, not when R is installed from source. R for Intel
will automatically use Rtools44 for Intel and R for ARM would automatically
use Rtools44 for ARM.</p>
<p>Now we are building packages using a custom installation of the toolchain
(the toolchain tarball) at an arbitrary location, and we use R installed
from the binary installer, and hence as shown above we set
<code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_PATH</code> and <code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT</code>. <code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_PATH</code> will
be prepended to PATH instead of the Rtools44 directories.
<code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT</code> value will be used as <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> (and
<code>LOCAL_SOFT</code>) instead of the Rtools44 soft directory. See below in this
text for discussion re <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code>.</p>
<p>This is not needed when installing R from source and building R packages
using that installation. In such case, the build tools and compilers already
have to be on PATH, and R uses by default <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> (and <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code>)
derived from that. See below in this text for discussion re <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code>.</p>
<p>One wouldn’t have to add <code>/usr/bin</code> to <code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_PATH</code> when running in
a standard installation of Msys2, but it is done here for instructional
purposes and may be useful in more complicated setups where a mix of tools
may be on PATH, such as in github actions (but note the problems with
incompatible Cygwin/Msys runtimes mentioned above).</p>
<p>Note in the above example that the compiler toolchain does not have to be on
PATH itself, but it would do no harm if it were.</p>
<p>Now run R from the same terminal by <code>/c/Program\ Files/R/R-devel/bin/R</code>. Try
installing “PKI”: <code>install.packages("PKI", type="source")</code>.</p>
<p>This will build from source <code>PKI</code> and its dependency <code>base64enc</code>.</p>
<p>Examples in this document use Msys2 with mintty and bash, which is the
default with Msys2 and is perhaps easier to use with building/testing for
those familiar with Unix. One can, however, also use cmd.exe, with the
benefit of nicer fonts and more reliable line editing (mintty uses a
different interface to communicate with RTerm).</p>
<h2 id="building-r-from-source-using-the-toolchain-tarball">Building R from source using the toolchain tarball</h2>
<p>Download and unpack Tcl/Tk bundle from
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a>, a file named such as

svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk

cd trunk
unzip ../$TCLBUNDLE

cd src/gnuwin32</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding version of the bundle for ARM would be named
<code>tcltk-6094-5412-aarch64.zip</code>.</p>
<p>Set environment variables. Note that when building R, one needs to have the
compiler toolchain on PATH, it is not added automatically in this case
(adjust below if the toolchain tarball was unpacked in a different
directory). The <code>R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT</code> and <code>R_CUSTOM_TOOL_PATH</code> variables are
not needed when buillding R from source, but setting them would do no harm:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/c/my_toolchain_location/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
export TAR=&quot;/usr/bin/tar&quot;
export TAR_OPTIONS=&quot;--force-local&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding location of the toolchain for ARM is
<code>aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>.</p>
<p>Test that the tools are available by running (set variables like for
building R packages, as shown above):</p>
<pre><code>which make gcc pdflatex tar</code></pre>
<p>On ARM, one could test also <code>which clang flang</code>.</p>
<p><code>MkRules.rules</code> expects Inno Setup in <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 6</code>.
If you have installed it into a different directory (such as by the
automated script above), specify it in <code>MkRules.local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;MkRules.local
ISDIR = C:/Program Files (x86)/InnoSetup
EOF</code></pre>
<p>On ARM, add these two additional lines to <code>MkRules.local</code>:</p>
<pre><code>USE_LLVM = 1
WIN =</code></pre>
<p>Build R and recommended packages:</p>
<pre><code>make rsync-recommended
make all recommended</code></pre>
<p>When the build succeeds, one can run R via <code>../../bin/R</code>.</p>
<p>To build the installer, run <code>make distribution</code>, it will appear in
<code>installer/R-*.exe</code>.</p>
<p>To build R with debug symbols, set <code>export DEBUG=T</code> in the terminal before
the build (and possibly add `EOPTS = -O0” to MkRules.local to disable
compiler optimizations, hence obtaining reliable debug information).</p>
<h2 id="testing-packages-using-github-actions">Testing packages using github actions</h2>
<p>Github default runners for github actions include Windows Server 2022, which
has support for UTF-8 as native encoding and has pre-installed build tools.
It is thus convenient to install only the toolchain tarball there, packaged
using Zstandard compression (smaller, faster to decompress).</p>
<p>For packages that only need libraries from the “base” toolchain, it is
better to use that, saving more time and bandwidth. The actions should
download the toolchain from github, not from CRAN servers.</p>
<p>R itself can be installed from the binary installer and cached. Caching the
toolchain itself is not helpful: the default compression currently used for
that is much less efficient than Zstandard, so using the cache checking
takes longer and requires more resources.</p>
<p>An experiment has been carried out using <code>codetools</code> (a package without
dependencies and not needing compilation) and using <code>tiff</code> (a package needed
compilation and depending on two more packages).</p>
<p>With <code>tiff</code>, checking with a missing toolchain (which fails) took over 1
minute. Checking with the base toolchain took nearly 2 minutes (and
passed, it is enough for the involved packages). Checking with the full
toolchain took 3 minutes (note: the timings are expected to vary based on
internal github setup). More information is available
<a href="https://github.com/kalibera/ucrt3">here</a>, based on “ucrt3”, so the
experimental builds of Rtools, but one finds among the experimental builds
also those that became Rtools releases.</p>
<p>Users of github actions are advised to read the section about pkg-config,
with a description of caveats seen on github action runners.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, github action runners did not support 64-bit
ARM Windows machines. Once they become available, they should be usable for
checking packages in a similar way.</p>
<h2 id="other-package-buildingchecking-options">Other package building/checking options</h2>
<p>As with previous versions of R and Rtools, the
<a href="https://win-builder.r-project.org/">Winbuilder</a> service can be used for
building and checking packages on Windows, with the same setup that is used
for CRAN incomming checks and CRAN binary package builds, with all CRAN and
Bioconductor packages available for checking.</p>
<p>Additional checking services are available including
<a href="https://builder.r-hub.io/">R-hub</a>.</p>
<p>Neither Winbuilder nor R-hub support the 64-bit ARM Windows machines at the
time of this writing.</p>
<h2 id="testing-packages-for-64-bit-arm">Testing packages for 64-bit ARM</h2>
<p>At the time of this writing, the best readily available option is probably
to run Windows 11 in a virtual machine on Apple Silicon hardware (tested
with UTM/QEMU, but should work also with other virtualization software).
This is likely to change in the near future.</p>
<p>Rtools since Rtools42 is itself cross-compiled and Rtools44 includes
cross-compilers which run on Linux/x86-64. It should be possible to test
building of R packages this way and to see problems already visible at
compilation time (though it is not normally done).</p>
<p>Issues specific to LLVM/clang would be easily found by testing on other
platforms, unless in Windows-specific code.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-packages-with-native-code">Debugging packages with native code</h2>
<p>R is built and distributed without debug symbols, so the first step should
be building R from source including debug symbols. It is recommended to
build R without compiler optimizations (<code>-O0</code>) to make sure the debug
symbols are precise (and only fall back to default optimizations if
necessary to reproduce the problem at hand).</p>
<p>It is better not to build the R installer, but use R for debugging from the
build tree, so that the sources are readily available for modification and
also for the debugger (otherwise one would have to instruct the debugger
where to find the sources; <code>directory</code> is the command for <code>gdb</code>). See the
previous sections on building R from source. Also, building the installer
takes much longer.</p>
<p>When R is built with debug symbols this way, R packages installed by it from
source will also have debug symbols. For debugging, it may be convenient to
install the package from a directory, rather than a tarball, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>tar xf PKI_0.1-11.tar.gz
../../bin/R CMD INSTALL PKI</code></pre>
<p>To use <code>gdb</code> as the debugger (when on Intel machines, see below for notes
for an ARM machine), one may install it using <code>pacman</code> in Rtools44 (and
hence Msys2) as follows:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Syuu
pacman -Sy gdb</code></pre>
<p>Lets say we want to debug PKI R function <code>PKI.genRSAkey</code> which is
implemented in C in <code>PKI_RSAkeygen</code>. We will need two Rtools44 (Msys2) shell
windows.</p>
<p>In the first window, run R, load the PKI package (DLL) and find out the
process ID:</p>
<pre><code>$ ../../bin/R
&gt; library(PKI)
Loading required package: base64enc

&gt; Sys.getpid()
[1] 11860</code></pre>
<p>In the second window, run <code>gdb</code>, attach to the R process, set a break-point
on the <code>PKI_RSAkeygen</code> function and let the R process continue:</p>
<pre><code>$ gdb
(gdb) attach 11860
Attaching to process 11860
(gdb) b PKI_RSAkeygen
Breakpoint 1 at 0x7ffd06226491: file pki-x509.c, line 629.
(gdb) c
Continuing.</code></pre>
<p>Now, in the first window, run the R function to debug:</p>
<pre><code>key &lt;- PKI::PKI.genRSAkey(bits = 512L)</code></pre>
<p>In the second window, the debugger will give a prompt to debug the C
function:</p>
<pre><code>Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 1, PKI_RSAkeygen (sBits=0x21fdea4b2a8) at pki-x509.c:629
629         int bits = asInteger(sBits);
(gdb)</code></pre>
<p>For more, please refer to GDB documentation. Useful commands are <code>p</code> (print
value of a variable), <code>c</code> (continue executing), <code>n</code> (execute one step not
interrupting inside called functions), <code>s</code> (execute one step interrupting inside
called functions), <code>bt</code> (print C stacktrace). One can also use <code>p</code> to call
some functions defined in R, e.g. to print R stacktrace (in the R window):</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p Rf_printwhere()</code></pre>
<p>And to print an R value (SEXP):</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p Rf_PrintValue()</code></pre>
<p>or to modify value of a variable.</p>
<p>Please note that interrupting R execution to enter the debugger by pressing
Ctrl-C does not work reliably, hence attaching to the R process is
preferred. Also please note that one cannot reliably place the breakpoint
before the DLL is loaded (pending breakpoints don’t work).</p>
<p>But, one can instruct R to enter the debugger prompt (break into it) if
running inside a debugger. Rgui has this feature. Run Rgui in <code>gdb</code>:</p>
<pre><code>gdb ../../bin/x64/Rgui.exe
(gdb) r</code></pre>
<p>And once Rgui opens up, load the package:</p>
<pre><code>library(PKI)</code></pre>
<p>and then resize the Rgui window to see also the gdb window and choose
<code>Misc/Break to debugger</code> from the Rgui menu. That way you will get into
<code>gdb</code> prompt in the terminal window from which you have run Rgui, and
continue as in the previous example.</p>
<p>On an ARM machine, install the package without staged installation:</p>
<pre><code>tar xf PKI_0.1-12.tar.gz
../../bin/R CMD INSTALL --no-staged-install PKI </code></pre>
<p>Install the LLVM lldb debugger:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Syuu
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-lldb</code></pre>
<p>Run the debugger:</p>
<pre><code>/clangarm64/bin/lldb</code></pre>
<p>Run these commands to attach to the R process, set the breakpoint and let
the R process continue:</p>
<pre><code>(lldb) attach 13608

<p>LLDB commands are sometimes similar to GDB, but not always the same. There
is a <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html">GDB to LLDB command map</a> for GDB
users.</p>
<p>Note also that on ARM, R directory layout is sligthly different. RGui and
RTerm are installed directly under <code>bin</code> as <code>bin/Rgui.exe</code> and
<code>bin/Rterm.exe</code>. On Intel, for historical reasons, it is as
<code>bin/x64/Rgui.exe</code> and <code>bin/x64/Rterm.exe</code>.</p>
<h3 id="additional-debugging-hints">Additional debugging hints</h3>
<p>It is recommended to perform C code modifications (adding debug messages,
checks, etc) when debugging issues. Oftentimes it may be easier than using
a debugger. In some cases, combining C code modifications and the debugger
is useful.</p>
<p>Inside R source code, one may also call a function <code>breaktodebuger()</code> which
does the same thing as entering the debugger from Rgui menu mentioned above.
In any code, including packages, a primitive trick is to cause a crash when
an interesting code path is reached. One can do this e.g. by <code>*(int *)0 = 1</code> in C. However, additional consideration is needed on Windows to make
sure the debugger is entered (more below).</p>
<p>For example, assume that we modify the PKI package file
<code>PKI/src/pki-x509.c</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>SEXP PKI_RSAkeygen(SEXP sBits) {
    EVP_PKEY *key;
    RSA *rsa;
    int bits = asInteger(sBits);
    if (bits == 2192)
        *(int *)0 = 1; /* crash */</code></pre>
<p>and reinstall the package using <code>R CMD INSTALL PKI</code>. Note that the trick may
not work with later compilers (it already doesn’t with some, but not those
used with R on Windows), which are too smart to see that we are inserting a
crash.</p>
<p>For this to work, <code>gdb</code> has to be on the image and process that will crash,
not on a parent process. One can debug <code>../../bin/x64/Rgui.exe</code> as shown
above, but to do this in Rterm, one needs to debug directly
<code>../../bin/x64/Rterm.exe</code> and run <code>gdb</code> from a standard Windows console
program, such as <code>cmd.exe</code>, e.g. as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19044.1620]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\tomas&gt;c:\rtools44\usr\bin\bash.exe -l

$ cd trunk/src/gnuwin32/
$ gdb ../../bin/x64/Rterm.exe</code></pre>
<p>The issue with the Rtools44/Msys2 shell (mintty terminal) is that it needs
(or at least used to need) re-execution using <code>winpty</code> for line editing to
work. That is done automatically by Rterm on Windows, but then we are not
running <code>gdb</code> on the process that will crash.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, <code>gdb</code> in Msys2/Rtools44 prints a python error
message at startup like</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;libstdcxx&#39;
/etc/gdbinit:6: Error in sourced command file:
Error while executing Python code.</code></pre>
<p>This is because of a missing Python module and has been reported to Msys2.
That module is part of the <code>gcc</code> package, which one may also install to get
rid of this, but then one has to be careful not to accidentally use that
version of <code>gcc</code> instead of the one from <code>/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>.
It is safe to instead ignore this error message.</p>
<h2 id="writingupdating-r-packages-for-rtools44">Writing/updating R packages for Rtools44</h2>
<p>R packages with only R code do not need any special consideration as they
don’t need Rtools. R packages with native code (C, Fortran, C++) but
without any dependencies on external libraries, should not need any
Rtools44-specific customizations; they should work even when authored for
Rtools40 or older.</p>
<p>Other packages will typically need some updates/consideration, because
traditionally R packages on Windows hard-code the list of libraries to link
and the include directories for headers, and so far there is not a working,
easy-to-use and reliable alternative (though pkg-config is available since
late Rtools43, more below). The updates are needed as things change in
Rtools. The changes between Rtools40 and Rtools42 were significant, but the
changes between Rtools42 and Rtools44 have been small and only several CRAN
packages had to be updated.</p>
<h3 id="including-standard-headers-in-c-code">Including standard headers in C++ code</h3>
<p>Several CRAN packages, when updating from Rtools43 to Rtools44, required addition
of an explicit include directive for <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code> in C++ code. This is due
to a change in GCC 13, which newly requires some of the headers to be
included explicitly. See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-13/porting_to.html">Porting to GCC
13</a> for more information and for
other potential issues when porting code to GCC 13 (and hence from Rtools43
to Rtools44), which were, however, not encountered in CRAN packages.</p>
<h3 id="conflicts-of-r-headers-with-windows-and-symbol-remapping">Conflicts of R headers with Windows (and symbol remapping)</h3>
<p>An upgrade to MinGW-W64 version 11 has revealed some issues with symbol
remapping done in R headers, which were not previously seen with MinGW-W64
version 10. A typical situation is that the system headers cannot be
compiled with re-mapped <code>error</code> or <code>length</code>. These cases can be normally
solved by re-ordering of the include directives so that the system headers
are included before R headers. This problem is not specific to Windows.
See <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-R-API">Writing R
Extensions</a>
for more details and advice.</p>
<h3 id="prepared-patches-for-packages">Prepared patches for packages</h3>
<p>During the transition from MSVCRT (and Rtools40) to UCRT (and Rtools 42),
patches were created for over a 100 of CRAN and Bioconductor packages. Some
packages have been fixed by adopting those patches, but other were fixed
differently. In case package authors run into a problem, it may be useful
first consulting an old patch when available, because it may be working fine
as is or after some small update.</p>
<p>A typical example would be using external libraries from Rtools44 as opposed
to downloading them (more in the next section). Also, some packages may
have been archived from CRAN as they haven’t been fixed in time, but the
patches to fix them are still available, so can be consulted if such
packages were to be re-submitted.</p>
<p>Later a number of patches have been created during transitions between
Rtools42 and Rtools44, some also for the aarch64 support. Package authors
have been notified about these patches, but they can still be found by
others for reference in case they were not adopted.</p>
<p>The patches are available
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/old_patches/">here</a>.</p>
<p>During a transitional period before the R 4.2.0 release, these patches were
applied automatically by (patched and then un-patched version of) R-devel at
installation time, but that is no longer the case. The history of the
patches, as well as some that were deleted rather than moved to
<code>old_patches</code>, can be found in the subversion history using a subversion
client.</p>
<p>Patches for packages that worked with Rtools43 but had to be updated for
Rtools44 are available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/patches/">here</a></p>
<p>These patches are not applied automatically by R-devel nor any released
version of R (they are sometimes applied automatically by experimental
“ucrt3” builds). Most of the few changes were changed linking orders due to
library updates, or updates for Windows/aarch64. As the packages get
updated, these patches are eventually moved away also to <code>old_patches</code>.</p>
<h3 id="linking-to-pre-built-static-libraries">Linking to pre-built static libraries</h3>
<p>With Rtools40, some R packages used to download external static libraries
during their installation from “winlibs”/“r-winlib” or other sources. When
these downloaded libraries were built for MSVCRT (incompatible with UCRT),
one got linking errors.</p>
<p>A common symptom was undefined references
to various symbols, often <code>__imp___iob_func</code>, <code>__ms_vsnprintf</code> or
<code>_setjmp</code>. Downloading
of external code is usually obvious from <code>src/Makevars.win</code> (e.g. presence
of “winlibs” or from <code>configure.win</code>) and from installation outputs.</p>
<p>These symptoms will be seen again when one accidentally links an
incompatible library built for MSVCRT. To fix this, one needs to instead
build against libraries built for UCRT.</p>
<p>While libraries built for UCRT may be available for download, it is not a
good idea downloading them during package installation and see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html">CRAN
Repository Policy</a>
for restrictions on CRAN. This section of the text and the old patches are
still available to help package authors to move away from downloading
pre-built static libraries.</p>
<p>For transparency, source packages should contain source (not executable
code). Using pre-compiled libraries may lead to that after few years the
information on how they were built gets lost or significantly outdated and
no longer working. Using older binary code may provide insufficient
performance (newer compilers tend to optimize better). Also, the CRAN (and
Bioconductor) repositories are used as a unique test suite not only for R
itself but also the toolchain, and by re-using pre-compiled libraries, some
parts will not be tested. Compiler bugs are found and when fixed, the code
needs to be re-compiled. Finally, object files (and hence static libraries,
particularly when using C++) on Windows tend to become incompatible when
even the same toolchain is upgraded. Going from MSVCRT to UCRT is an
extreme case when all such code becomes incompatible, and adding support to
64-bit ARM has been another extreme case, but smaller updates of different
parts of the toolchain or even some libraries in it lead to
incompatibilities. The issues mentioned here are based on experience with
the transition to UCRT and Rtools42, and with support for 64-bit ARM added
in Rtools44; all of these things have happened and dealing with the
downloads and re-use of static libraries was one of the biggest challenges.</p>
<p>As an example of the necessary updates to move from downloading of
pre-compiled static libraries, package <code>tiff</code> used to have in
<code>src/Makevars.win</code>:</p>
<pre><code>RWINLIB = ../windows/libtiff-4.1.0/mingw$(WIN)
PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I$(RWINLIB)/include
PKG_LIBS = -L$(RWINLIB)/lib -ltiff -ljpeg -lz

all: clean winlibs

winlibs:
        &quot;${R_HOME}/bin${R_ARCH_BIN}/Rscript.exe&quot; &quot;../tools/winlibs.R&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To make the package build with UCRT and Rtools44, one could
replace these lines by:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS = -ltiff -ljpeg -lz -lzstd -lwebp -llzma 
all: clean 
</code></pre>
<p>Note that even Rtools40 had these libraries, so one could make a similar
change also for building the package with Rtools40 (even for MSVCRT, so avoid
downloading pre-compiled libraries).</p>
<p>However, the same set and ordering of libraries often does not work with
Rtools40, because the names would sometimes be different (in some cases,
though, it is still possible to create a linking order that works with both
Rtools44 and Rtools40 (and Rtools42, Rtools43), when libraries are available
in under the same name).</p>
<p>So, typically, a new Makevars file was needed, and R 4.2 added support for
<code>Makevars.ucrt</code> for that, which are used in preference of <code>Makevars.win</code>,
when present. See Writing R Extensions for more information about support
for <code>configure.ucrt</code>, <code>cleanup.ucrt</code>, <code>Makefile.ucrt</code> and <code>Makevars.ucrt</code>
files. Packages meant and specified to work only with R 4.2 and newer should
use the traditional <code>.win</code> suffixes with the new content.</p>
<p>The differences between Rtools42 and Rtools44 are small and no new
extensions for such files were added.</p>
<p>Since Rtools43 release 5863, pkg-config can be used to establish the linking
order for tiff via <code>pkg-config --libs libtiff-4</code> (more details are provided
later in this text).</p>
<p>In some cases, a Makevars file may need to refer directly to a directory
with header files or a library file. It is better to avoid such direct
references for portability, but if needed, one may use <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> make
variable.</p>
<p><code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> is set to the root of the compiled native toolchain,
<code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code>/include is automatically available for headers,
<code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code>/lib is automatically available for libraries, but when one
needs to refer to files in different locations or for different tools, one
may have to use that variable.</p>
<p>There is also <code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> variable which by default points to the root of
the compiled toolchain and in some CRAN packages has been used for this
purpose (well before this toolchain existed). However, the original idea of
<code>LOCAL_SOFT</code> was to use it for libraries not available with the toolchain,
like <code>/usr/local</code> is used on Unix machines to refer to software not part of
the OS distribution. It is hence more portable to use <code>R_TOOLS_SOFT</code> for
the purpose of referring to the libraries/headers which are part of the
toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-toolchain-and-libraries-from-source">Building the toolchain and libraries from source</h2>
<p>The toolchain and libraries are built using a modified version of
<a href="https://mxe.cc/">MXE</a>, which is available
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/mxe">here</a>.
The build is run on an x86_64 Linux machine, so it involves building a
GCC13/MinGW-W64/UCRT cross-compilation toolchain, cross-compiling a large
number of libraries needed by R and R packages, and then building also a
native compiler toolchain so that R and R packages can be built natively on
Windows.</p>
<p>Scripts for setting up the build in docker running Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora are
available
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/">here</a>.
However, this is easy enough and convenient to run natively. On Ubuntu
22.04, following the <a href="https://mxe.cc/#requirements-debian">MXE documentation</a>,
install these packages:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install -y \
      autoconf \
      automake \
      autopoint \
      bash \
      bison \
      bzip2 \
      flex \
      g++ \
      g++-multilib \
      gettext \
      git \
      gperf \
      intltool \
      libc6-dev-i386 \
      libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev \
      libltdl-dev \
      libgl-dev \
      libpcre3-dev \
      libssl-dev \
      libtool-bin \
      libxml-parser-perl \
      lzip \
      make \
      openssl \
      p7zip-full \
      patch \
      perl \
      python3 \
      python3-distutils \
      python3-mako \
      python3-pkg-resources \
      python3-setuptools \
      python2 \
      python-is-python3 \
      ruby \
      sed \
      unzip \
      wget \
      xz-utils</code></pre>
<p>And then also install these:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install -y texinfo sqlite3 zstd gtk-doc-tools libopengl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev autoconf-archive</code></pre>
<p>For Fedora distributions, see the script <code>build_in_docker.sh</code> for the
required dependencies. Please refer to the script for any updates to the
list of packages shown above also for Debian/Ubuntu.</p>
<p>If you wish to do everything from scratch, run <code>make</code> (or <code>make -j</code>) in
<code>mxe</code> (see the next section for how to re-use pre-compiled binaries to
reduce the time needed). The build takes about 2 hours on a server machine
with 20 cores, so don’t expect that to be fast, but then building individual
MXE packages (new, modified) is fast as the build is incremental using
<code>make</code>. It has been reported that 8G of RAM and two cores is enough for the
build. Even a full re-build is reasonably fast as MXE uses ccache.</p>
<p>The result will appear in <code>mxe/usr</code>, the native toolchain and libraries
specifically in <code>mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>. The content of
that directory is currently just packed into a tarball available as
e.g. <code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst</code>
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a>,
with some filtering to reduce the size.</p>
<p>The rest of <code>mxe/usr</code> is then packed into a tarball available
as e.g. <code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-cross-6094.tar.zst</code>, as it contains the
cross-compilation toolchain.</p>
<p>When cross-compiling for ARM, run <code>make</code> with <code>R_TARGET=aarch64</code>. The build
takes considerably longer that for Intel, as LLVM and flang take
particularly long: in practice, arrange to run “overnight” when building
from scratch. The corresponding tarball would be named
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-aarch64-6094.tar.zst</code> and the toolchain and
libraries would appear in directory
<code>mxe/usr/aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>.</p>
<p>The toolchain is now regularly built in a docker container using the
provided script. One of the advantages is that it is easier to ensure that
absolute paths (some files use them, see below) are set up properly, but for
experimentation and development, it is easy to work natively on Linux.</p>
<p>By default, <code>make</code> builds the full toolchain. This is controlled by make
variable <code>R_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE</code>, so to build the (smaller) base toolchain, run</p>
<pre><code>make -j R_TOOLCHAIN_TYPE=base</code></pre>
<h2 id="setting-up-mxe-build-from-pre-built-tarballs">Setting up MXE build from pre-built tarballs</h2>
<p>To save the time of building the full toolchain from scratch, e.g. when the
goal is to create a new MXE package or upgrade an existing one, one might
re-use the pre-compiled code already distributed in the full and the
cross-compiler toolchain tarball. This requires root access to the machine
(to create a symlink, indeed one may do this in docker) and is not regularly
tested as Rtools built tree is normally started from scratch.</p>
<p>With the current/given version number of Rtools44, here we assume it is
6094, one can proceed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>svn checkout -r 6094 https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs/mxe
cd mxe
wget
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/rtools44-toolchain-libs-cross-6094.tar.zst
wget https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst

mkdir usr
cd usr
tar xf ../rtools44-toolchain-libs-cross-6094.tar.zst
tar xf ../rtools44-toolchain-libs-full-6094.tar.zst
cd ..

MXE_ROOT=`pwd`/usr
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/mxe
sudo ln -s $MXE_ROOT /usr/lib/mxe

make ccache

make -j MXE_BUILD_DRY_RUN=1
make -j MXE_BUILD_DRY_RUN=1 # repeat until [pkg-list] is last line of output
rm `find usr -name &quot;*.dry-run&quot;`

make -j # a check that nothing is built
</code></pre>
<p>The “make ccache” step will build the compiler cache tool and create native
C/C++ and cross compilers as links to it. The compiler cache will speed up
repeated compilations.</p>
<p>The “dry run” will download all source packages (about 1G at the time of
this writing) and it will create as a side effect also time-stamps telling
MXE that the packages have already been built. The command needs to be
repeated twice (or more times, if there are intermittent download failures)
until the output looks like this (nothing downloaded, no “[dry-run]”):</p>
<pre><code>fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
Building full R toolchain
[pkg-list]  # long list of packages in the list
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that errors about failed downloads will be displayed even when
the package is later sucessfully downloaded from a backup location. The best
way to see all has been downloaded correctly is to keep repeating the
command as suggested.</p>
<p>The error re “not a git repository” can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>The time-stamps are necessary, the downloading isn’t (and one probably could
easily comment out that part in Makefile if needed, but there doesn’t seem
to be an obvious elegant solution) because libraries have already been
built.</p>
<p>One can then check that MXE knows/thinks that all packages are up to date
simply by running</p>
<pre><code>make -j</code></pre>
<p>Which should take a few seconds only to figure out that nothing has to be
done, so again “[pkg-list]” should be the last line of output.</p>
<p>Please note that this does not create a completely identical output to
building from scratch. It does not include some files excluded from Rtools
to limit size (test executables, executables not needed by R packages). It
does not re-create symlinks but instead has file copies as this is how the
tarballs are created to be Windows-friendly. But it should be enough for
most use cases.</p>
<p>Now one can use the dependencies in make file to rebuild only what is
needed, e.g. running</p>
<pre><code>touch src/libxml2.mk
make -j</code></pre>
<p>rebuilds XML library and all packages that depend on it (note: expect this
to take about 15 minutes on a server machine when ran the first time, the
second run would be faster because of ccache).</p>
<p>The description above assumes that the target is Intel. For ARM targets,
update the names of the tarballs to download and specify the aarch64 target
to <code>make</code>.</p>
<h2 id="addingupdating-an-mxe-package">Adding/updating an MXE package</h2>
<p>Some R packages cannot be built or don’t work, because they depend on an
external library not available in the toolchain. To add such software, one
needs to create an appropriate MXE package or update one.
<a href="https://mxe.cc/">MXE</a> documentation has more details, but for example the
package for the tiff library is named “tiff” and available
<a href="https://github.com/mxe/mxe/blob/master/src/tiff.mk">here</a> and did not have
to be customized for R:</p>

<p>One may add a new package to <code>src</code>, then build it using <code>make pkgname</code>, and
when ready, add that to <code>settings.mk</code> to the <code>LOCAL_PKG_LIST</code> so that it is
built automatically. One the needs to copy the updated
<code>usr/86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> to the Windows machine and perform R
package builds there.</p>
<p>When maintaining open-source software distributions, often one may take
inspiration from somewhere else. First, many packages are already available
in MXE; if they just work, they only need to be added to <code>settings.mk</code>.</p>
<p>Then, some packages may be available in a similar customized version of MXE
used by Octave, <a href="https://wiki.octave.org/MXE">MXE-Octave</a>. Then some
packages popular in the R community but not present in MXE may be available
in <a href="https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages">Msys2</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/r-windows/rtools-packages">Rtools40</a>, yet those package
configurations are in a different format and not written for
cross-compilation nor static linking. Linux distributions, e.g. Debian,
then have much bigger selection of build configurations of packages, again
in a different format.</p>
<p>If your package needs a library not currently supported by the modified
version of MXE used to build in this toolchain, you are welcome to provide a
build configuration for such library. Primarily, such package
configuration would be contributed directly to upstream MXE, which may be a
forcing function to test such package in a wider context (e.g. also
dynamic linking, also MSVCRT, etc), but a much wider group of users will be
able to benefit from that. Also, it would reduce the maintenance overhead
of the toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-the-linking-order-from-existing-patches">Establishing the linking order from existing patches</h2>
<p>As noted above, R packages on Windows need to specify a linking order,
ordered names of libraries to link to the package. In the past it had to be
done explicitly by listing the libraries, but from Rtools44 release 5863 one
can also do this also via pkg-config. For both cases, a script is provided
which simplifies the process, as detailed below.</p>
<p>Patches were created for package authors during the transition from Rtools40
to Rtools42. Some of them were still not applied to packages
by their maintainers); they are available
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/r_packages/old_patches/">here</a>
and may be used as a starting point for linking orders needed.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-the-linking-order-in-r-packages-via-pkg-config">Establishing the linking order in R packages via pkg-config</h2>
<p>Pkg-config is now part of Rtools and can be used from R packages’ Makevars
files to establish the linking order for external libraries, given the names
of MXE packages providing those libraries. This should reduce the frequency
of necessary tweaks to the linking orders on Rtools updates. One can use
pkg-config conditionally to support older versions of Rtools, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>ifeq (,$(shell pkg-config --version 2&gt;/dev/null))
   LIBSHARPYUV = $(or $(and $(wildcard $(R_TOOLS_SOFT)/lib/libsharpyuv.a),-lsharpyuv),)
   PKG_LIBS = -ltiff -ljpeg -lz -lzstd -lwebp $(LIBSHARPYUV) -llzma
else
   PKG_LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs libtiff-4)
endif </code></pre>
<p>It is not the case for tiff, but with other libraries, it may be necessary
to also use special C preprocessor options, and some would regard that as
portable to do that always:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_CPPFLAGS = $(shell pkg-config --cflags libtiff-4)</code></pre>
<p>The code above can be added to the package <code>src/Makevars.ucrt</code>
(<code>src/Makevars.win</code>) of package tiff. One still has to figure out that the
pkg-config package name is <code>libtiff-4</code> (while e.g. the MXE package is
<code>tiff</code>, Msys2 package is <code>libtiff</code>), hints are provided below.</p>
<p>One caveat of the test of presense of <code>pkg-config</code> is that if a package is
being built using older Rtools (without pkg-config), but <code>pkg-config</code> is
found on PATH e.g. from Msys2, that Msys2 <code>pkg-config</code> will be used and
package installation would fail. With github actions, an installation of
pkg-config may be found from Strawbery perl.</p>
<p>It is not just about finding the <code>.pc</code> files. While it would be possible to
instruct a different installation of <code>pkg-config</code> where to find the <code>.pc</code>
(pkg-config configuration) files with older versions of Rtools, those <code>.pc</code>
files were often missing or incomplete, so the build would fail. Also a
different version of <code>pkg-config</code> may not work: the one in Rtools
automatically uses <code>--static</code> (looking for static libraries) and explicitly
does not use <code>--pure</code> (which doesn’t currently work with pkg-config files in
MXE/Rtools), but a different installation may have different defaults. It
is not desirable to hard-code these options directly in Makevars files, to
e.g. allow for experimental builds with dynamic libraries, etc.</p>
<p>Package authors who wish to use pkg-config in their packages together with
github actions should make sure to update Rtools to a version at least 5863.
Package authors who want to check their packages using github actions with
Rtools42 would have to update their scripts to avoid this problem. For
example, one can create a dummy <code>pkg-config</code> script, which will do nothing,
in the old Rtools, such as:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;#! /bin/bash&quot; &gt; x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin/pkg-config</code></pre>
<p>Additional caveats have been seen with github actions, a version of the
Windows 2022 runner. The runner uses GNU make from Chocolatey rather than
from Msys2. While the example above testing presence of pkg-config works
fine with Msys2 build of GNU make, it currently doesn’t work with that of
Chocolatey. The problem is that this build of make would not use the shell
to execute <code>pkg-config</code> in <code>$(shell pkg-config --cflags libtiff-4)</code>, so it
would not find pkg-config (pkg-config is a shell script), but instead it
would use a batch file <code>pkg-config.bat</code> from Strawberry perl (even though
later on PATH than Rtools), which will fail. This is due to an optimization
in make which attempts to avoid running the shell for “simple” code.
However, the version check, <code>$(shell pkg-config --version 2&gt;/dev/null)</code> will
succeed, because make will use the shell for that, it would run the correct
version of pkg-config from Rtools.</p>
<p>One can work this around in the github actions by creating a <code>.bat</code> file
wrapper for <code>pkg-config</code>, e.g. via</p>
<pre><code>echo &#39;@sh %~dp0/pkg-config %*&#39; &gt; x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin/pkg-config.bat</code></pre>
<p>This wrapper is part of Rtools44 since revision 5868 and uses a shell to
execute the pkg-config shell script. It is still desirable to check any
github actions installation carefully to see whether the right pkg-config is
being used. The problems may differ on different installations of github
actions and with different approaches to conditioning on pkg-config
presence. For example, just unconditionally querying <code>--libs</code> and
conditioning then on whether the result is empty or not would fall back to
non-pkg-config branch, hiding a problem in the github actions setup when in
fact Rtools already have working pkg-config.</p>
<p>The <code>Makevars.ucrt</code> example above also shows how one may conditionally link
libraries based on their presence without pkg-config. Sharpyuv has been
added as a separate library in webp at some point, and the conditioning
allowed the package to link with older and newer webp.</p>
<p>The linking order can be obtained via <code>pkg-config</code> also on the
cross-compilation host (Linux), one may run</p>
<pre><code>env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib/pkgconfig ./usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/pkgconf --static libtiff-4 --libs-only-l</code></pre>
<p>Usability of pkg-config depends on how libraries specify their dependencies
via pkg-config <code>.pc</code> files. Not all software provides such files. Also,
often these files are not well tested with static libraries and some
dependencies are missing. These files are sometimes generated by other
tools, which provide libraries explicitly (via <code>Libs:</code> or <code>Libs.private:</code>)
rather than by linking to other <code>.pc</code> files (via <code>Requires:</code> or
<code>Requires.private</code>), which make the files harder to read. Also, libraries
are sometimes duplicated.</p>
<p>A significant effort has been invested into fixing/adding these files in MXE
and in Rtools. The fixes in Rtools were targeted at R packages that needed
frequent changes in their linking order on Rtools update in the past
(geospatial libraries, libraries using tiff or openssl) and at packages that
still are using pre-compiled static libraries from external sources, but
where these libraries are available in Rtools (note: patches were provided
for packages with explicit linking orders already at the transition
from Rtools40 to Rtools42). The remaining R packages which need
compilation, that is those that didn’t need frequent updates to linking but
which do use libraries from Rtools, may still switch to pkg-config and
authors are invited to report issues in <code>.pc</code> files should they appear.</p>
<p>Patches were provided for some of the packages from the first group (which
needed frequent updates to linking orders when not using pkg-config).</p>
<p>From the second group, R CRAN packages that are still downloading
pre-compiled static libraries, even though they are available in Rtools
(which is in violation of CRAN repository policy), can use these pkg-config
packages: apcf (geos), av (libavfilter), clustermq (libzmq), curl (curl),
eaf (gsl), gdtools (cairo, freetype2), gert (libgit2), ggiraph (libpng), gpg
(gpgme), gslnls (gsl), hdf5r (hdf5_hl, WRAP = 1_12_0, -DH5_USE_110_API),
ijtiff (libtiff-4), image.textlinedetector (opencv4), jqr (jq), magick
(Magick++), opencv (opencv4), openssl (libssh2), pdftools (poppler-cpp), QF
(gsl), ragg (freetype2, libtiff-4, libjpeg), rcontroll (gsl), redland
(redland), redux (hiredis), RMariaDB (libmariadbclient), RMySQL
(libmariadbclient), RPostgres (libpq), rsvg (librsvg-2.0), rvg (libpng),
rzmq (libzmq), sodium (libsodium), ssh (libssh), strawr (libcurl), surveyvoi
(mpfr), svglite (libpng), systemfonts (freetype2), textshaping (freetype2,
harfbuzz, fribidi), V8 (libv8), vdiffr (libpng), webp (libwebp), websocket
(openssl), xml2 (libxml-2.0), xslt (libexslt). With some, it is necessary
to also set <code>PKG_CPPFLAGS</code> using pkg-config, not just <code>PKG_LIBS</code>.</p>
<p>Again, if your favorite library does not support pkg-config or doesn’t
support it well, you are welcome to provide a fix (primarily to the software
at hand, possible to MXE, as a last resort directly to Rtools).</p>
<h2 id="computing-linking-orders-background">Computing linking orders (background)</h2>
<p>This section may be skipped by those looking only for instructions to
follow, rather than understanding the details of the problem.</p>
<p>R on Windows uses static linking. Static libraries are just archives of
object files, without any references to other static libraries they may need
as dependencies. The linker keeps track of the currently undefined symbols
and goes through the list of libraries (so archives of object files) from
left to right. If an object file from a library defines a symbol that the
linker knows is undefined, the linker will add that object file to the
binary. It will then add any additional object files from the same library
which define any undefined symbols arising from the same library, but it
will not add other object files from that library. This may result in that
new symbols would become undefined after processing that library. These
symbols have to be defined by some of the additional libraries in the list.</p>
<p>For this to work, one needs to make sure that any time one library uses a
symbol from another library, it is processed earlier by the linker. This is
a problem when there is a loop of dependent libraries, however, one can
usually resolve that by adding some libraries multiple times to the list or
moving some library in the list, taking advantage of the mechanism described
above: only the object files with some currently needed symbols are added
from the library.</p>
<p>The GNU linker also allows to specify linking groups, within which linking
is repeated in the given order re-starting until all symbols are resolved
(see <code>--start-group</code> and <code>--end-group</code>), with a price in performance. This
feature has not been needed yet in Rtools44.</p>
<p>Symbols exported from object files and actually missing at linking time are
mostly unique in Rtools44. Non-unique are some inlined
C++ functions (but then they are not missing at linking time), alternative
implementations (e.g. parallel OpenBLAS, serial OpenBLAS, reference BLAS),
runtime library wrappers (but they are not missing at linking time). As
these exceptions are rare, it was possible to come up with a simple tool
which can reasonably well advice on the list and order of libraries to link,
with heuristics to resolve some edge cases.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this is done in Unix using <code>lorder</code> script and <code>tsort</code>.
<code>lorder</code> generates a list of dependencies between static libraries,
defensively assuming that all object files from those libraries are needed.
<code>tsort</code> establishes a topological ordering on the result of <code>lorder</code>. One
can just try to build an R package without linking any libraries, parse the
output from the linker looking for undefined symbols, find static libraries
providing such symbols, and establish the topological ordering. The
resulting linking order can be then added to the <code>src/Makevars.ucrt</code>
(<code>src/Makevars.win</code>), the build of the R package tried again, generating
another list of undefined symbols. Then one can merge the list of libraries
established previously with the list established now, do the topological
sort again, and iterate this way until linking succeeds. <code>findLinkingOrder</code>
does this, with some additional heuristics, as shown below.</p>
<p>This is how linking orders for most patched CRAN packages were obtained, but
thorough testing is needed to figure out whether they produce a working
package. In principle, a better tool could definitely make this process
faster and more automated, and not requiring manual iterative linking
attempts.</p>
<p>Some manual adaptations to the linking orders created that way were needed,
anyway, and probably always will. These included resolving loops (<code>tsort</code>
gives warning when it sees them, which is a hint) by shifting libraries in
the ordering and adding some twice. Also, some symbols are not completely
unique in the toolchain and the semi-automated process did not choose the
best library (e.g. <code>libmincore</code> and <code>libwindowsapp</code> should not be linked,
because they depend on console Windows DLLs which are not present on Windows
Server). <code>-lsbml-static</code> should be used instead of <code>-lsbml.dll</code> (the latter
is an import library for a DLL, not a static library with the code per se).</p>
<p>None of this should be needed if the <code>pkg-config</code> databases were fixed to
work reliably with static linking. That could be done via improving MXE
package configurations, but the effort required may be bigger than improving
a hint tool described above, but if fixed, the results could be more
reliable. One still would need to know the right names of the pkg-config
packages, which are distribution specific.</p>
<p>Note that similar problems with other toolchains may be hidden when
pre-built (bigger) static libraries are being downloaded during package
installation.</p>
<h2 id="using-findlinkingorder-with-rtools44-tiff-package-example">Using findLinkingOrder with Rtools44 (tiff package example)</h2>
<p>In the end all the linking orders in patches for CRAN and Bioconductor
packages mentioned above were established via computation over the
compiled static libraries as described above, based on which
<code>findLinkingOrder</code> has been created.</p>
<p>This example uses Rtools44 and binary build of R. Run Rtools44 shell (Msys2
bash), download and extract the source package <code>tiff</code>. Create a temporary
<code>Makevars.ucrt</code> file as follows:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS = -Wl,--no-demangle $(shell cat /tmp/tiff.libs)</code></pre>
<p>Get the <code>findLinkingOrder</code> tool</p>
<pre><code>svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/linking_order</code></pre>
<p>Run the tool, specifying the file to hold the found linking order:</p>
<pre><code>./linking_order/findLinkingOrder tiff /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>First time, it will take long as it will be creating an index of the
libraries. The end of the output is:</p>
<pre><code>Installation failed, trying to find required link order
 -ltiff

Saved in /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>Which means, that the linking was not successful (indeed, we provided no
libraries), but we know that the directly missing symbols will be satisfied
by <code>-ltiff</code>, which was automatically added. So lets simply run the tool
again:</p>
<pre><code>./linking_order/findLinkingOrder tiff /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>The output now ends with:</p>
<pre><code>Installation failed, trying to find required link order
-ltiff -lzstd -lz -lwebpdecoder -lwebp -llzma -ljpeg -lcfitsio

Saved in /tmp/tiff.libs</code></pre>
<p>Which means that <code>-ltiff</code> was not enough, but there is an extended
suggestions. Lets run the tool the same way again. The output ends with</p>
<pre><code>Installation succeeded!</code></pre>
<p>Which means the list of libraries is complete. So now we can modify the
<code>Makevars.ucrt</code> using the computed list of libraries:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS=-ltiff -lzstd -lz -lwebpdecoder -lwebp -llzma -ljpeg -lcfitsio</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-Wl,--no-demangle</code> option is removed, because it is only needed for the
tool (and only for code using C++).</p>
<p>The script is also useful whe one wants to use pkg-config. In that case, it
is probably simpler to use simply:</p>
<pre><code>PKG_LIBS = -Wl,--no-demangle</code></pre>
<p>and provide the tool with a non-existent dummy file, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>rm /tmp/dummy.libs ; /linking_order/findLinkingOrder tiff /tmp/dummy.libs</code></pre>
<p>The first iteration would still yield <code>-ltiff</code>. One would then inspect the
directory with pkg-config files
(<code>x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib/pkgconfig</code>) and look for a <code>.pc</code> file
corresponding to it. It is usually easy to guess the name of the <code>.pc</code> file,
but this command commonly helps when needed:</p>
<pre><code>grep -- -ltiff *pc | grep Libs: | cut -d: -f1</code></pre>
<p>which gives:</p>
<pre><code>gtk+-2.0.pc
gtk+-win32-2.0.pc
libtiff-4.pc
spatialite.pc</code></pre>
<p>And it can be easily found manually that <code>libtiff-4</code> is the name of the
pkg-config file for the tiff library. Typically, guessing the name of the
<code>.pc</code> file is easier than this. Unfortunately, names of these <code>.pc</code> files
vary somewhat between platforms/distributions.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-library-loading-failures">Troubleshooting library loading failures</h2>
<p>Sometimes a package DLL is linked succesfully, but the DLL cannot be loaded.
Sometimes it can be loaded on the machine where it was built, but not on
another machine. One example is the linking of console API present on
Windows 10, but not on Windows Server. A common problem why a DLL cannot be
loaded is that a dependent DLL is not found (unlike static libraries, DLLs
know their dependencies). This is a common problem which can happen on
Windows with any toolchain.</p>
<p>When this happens to a DLL linked to an application, such as <code>Rblas</code> linked
to <code>R</code>, an error message will appear helpfully saying that <code>Rblas</code> could not
be found. However, when such DLL is being loaded explicitly via a Windows
API call (to <code>LoadLibrary</code>), which is the case when loading DLLs of R
packages, Windows is unable to say which DLL is missing:</p>
<pre><code>Error: package or namespace load failed for &#39;magick&#39; in inDL(x, as.logical(local
), as.logical(now), ...):
 unable to load shared object &#39;C:/msys64/home/tomas/ucrt3/svn/ucrt3/r_packages/r
inst/library/00LOCK-magick/00new/magick/libs/x64/magick.dll&#39;:
  LoadLibrary failure:  The specified module could not be found.</code></pre>
<p>Note: in the above, <code>magick.dll</code> is present on the path listed. It is some
of its dependencies that is not found, but Windows would tell which one.
The confusing error message comes directly from Windows and R cannot
possibly fix that.</p>
<p>There is still a way to debug this. One can install
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/">WinDbg</a>
from Microsoft (for free), which also includes
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/gflags">gflags</a>.</p>
<p>Using <code>gflags /i Rterm.exe +sls</code> (note <code>gflags</code> gets installed to <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\</code>) set “loader snaps” for the R executable. Then run
R, get its process ID using <code>Sys.getpid()</code>, start <code>WinDbg</code>, attach to the R
process via that process ID, type ‘g’ (to continue running). In the R
process, try to load the problematic package, e.g. <code>library(magick)</code>. This
will produce a number of messages, but in this case, one of them was</p>
<pre><code>3e94:29f8 @ 674068078 - LdrpProcessWork - ERROR: Unable to load DLL: &quot;api-ms-win-core-console-l1-2-0.dll&quot;, Parent Module: &quot;C:\msys64\home\tomas\ucrt3\svn\ucrt3\r\build_opt\trunk\library\magick\libs\x64\magick.dll&quot;, Status: 0xc0000135</code></pre>
<p>Which made it clear that <code>api-ms-win-core-console-l1-2-0.dll</code> was the
missing DLL.</p>
<p>The flag can be removed using <code>-sls</code>. Note that the Msys2 console (mintty
with bash, by default) is very different from cmd.exe in Windows: the latter
uses a different API and e.g. sometimes shows more debugging messages,
etc. It is better to use cmd.exe when debugging (with <code>WinDbg</code> but also
gdb). One may use <code>gdb</code> from Msys2 with this toolchain the same way as with
Rtools40.</p>
<h2 id="native-building-of-external-applications-jags">Native building of external applications: JAGS</h2>
<p>R packages are sometimes linked against dynamic libraries installed by
external applications. It may become necessary to rebuild such libraries as
well to be built for UCRT. It is advisable for encodings to be handled
properly (yet that depends on how that library handles encodings), but it
may be the least inconvenient solution also to avoid other clashes between
runtimes, such as in memory allocation.</p>
<p><a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is
used by R package rjags and some other packages. JAGS is installed as a
standalone application via its interactive installer and includes shared
libraries (JAGS library and a number of modules) and C headers. R packages
at build time use those C headers and link against that JAGS shared library.</p>
<p>When R package rjags is built with Rtools44 and linked against the JAGS
library from the official JAGS 4.3.0 distribution, it does not work. The
linking of the R package library is successful, but building of the package
indices fails, unfortunately without any detailed error message. The problem
is that building of package indices already involves loading the rjags
package and running it, and that crashes because of C runtime mismatch, the
JAGS library built for MSVCRT ends up calling UCRT free function on an
object allocated using MSVCRT.</p>
<p>There is now an official distribution of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Windows/JAGS-4.3.1.exe">JAGS
4.3.1</a>
for UCRT, which needs to be used with R &gt;= 4.2 on Windows instead of JAGS
4.3.0. The following text contains instructions which were used before to
create an unofficial JAGS 4.3.0 build using Rtools42, which may still be
useful as inspiration for building other applications. The instructions
still work with Rtools44 and JAGS 4.3.2 for Intel platforms, except that the
patch for the installer no longer needs to be applied.</p>
<p>The script used to create the unofficial build is available
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/extra/jags">here</a>.</p>
<p>JAGS uses <code>configure</code>, but when running in Msys2, the host system
identification is different from what the MXE-built toolchain has, so some
utilities (but not all) are not detected correctly. <code>configure</code> has to be
run with <code>--host=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code>.</p>
<p>Futhermore, as documented in JAGS installation manual, JAGS uses libtool and
libtool will not link a static library to a shared library created as
“module”. This causes trouble for some JAGS modules, such as “bugs”, which
link against LAPACK and BLAS. Rtools44 includes static libraries for
reference LAPACK and BLAS, but libtool refuses to link them (also, they
don’t have <code>.la</code> files).</p>
<p>This can be solved by building wrapper dynamic libraries for these static
LAPACK and BLAS libraries, following instructions from the JAGS manual, with
the toolchain on PATH (as when building R and packages):</p>
<pre><code>export TLIB=~/svn/ucrt3/r/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/lib
dlltool -z libblas.def --export-all-symbols $TLIB/libblas.a
gfortran -shared -o libblas.dll -Wl,--out-implib=libblas.dll.a libblas.def $TLIB/libblas.a
dlltool -z liblapack.def --export-all-symbols $TLIB/liblapack.a
gfortran -shared -o liblapack.dll -Wl,--out-implib=liblapack.dll.a liblapack.def $TLIB/liblapack.a  -L. -lblas
SHAREDLB=`pwd`</code></pre>
<p>One can then provide these libraries to JAGS configure via
<code>-with-blas="-L$SHAREDLB -lblas" --with-lapack="-L$SHAREDLB -llapack"</code>, where
<code>$SHAREDLB</code> is the directory with <code>liblapack.dll</code> and <code>libblas.dll</code>. These two
DLLs have to be then copied into the JAGS build tree before running the
installer:</p>
<pre><code>./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix --with-blas=&quot;-L$SHAREDLB -lblas&quot; --with-lapack=&quot;-L$SHAREDLB -llapack&quot;
make win64-install
cp $SHAREDLB/libblas.dll $SHAREDLB/liblapack.dll win/inst64/bin
make installer</code></pre>
<p>But, before running <code>make installer</code>, one needs to fix the installer script
for 64-bit-only build. The original installer supported both 32-bit and
64-bit architecture, but R on Windows since R 4.2 and Rtools42 only supports 64-bit.
The patch is available with the build script,
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/extra/jags">here</a>.</p>
<p>This example only works on the Intel platform.</p>
<h2 id="native-building-of-external-libraries-nlopt">Native building of external libraries: Nlopt</h2>
<p>Nlopt is included in Rtools44, so it does not have to be built for use with
R packages (and it shouldn’t be according to CRAN repository policy, because
it is available in the system). But it can be built in Rtools44 simply
as follows (version
<a href="https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt/archive/v2.7.1.tar.gz">2.7.1</a>):</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin/:$PATH
tar xf v2.7.1.tar.gz
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../nlopt-2.7.1 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DNLOPT_PYTHON=OFF \
      -DNLOPT_OCTAVE=OFF -DNLOPT_MATLAB=OFF -DNLOPT_GUILE=OFF \
      -DNLOPT_SWIG=OFF
cmake --build .</code></pre>
<p>On ARM platform, the path to the toolchain is
`/aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin/’.</p>
<p>CMake is part of the toolchain (so built by MXE) and is patched to use Unix
Makefiles as the default generator.</p>
<h2 id="cross-compilation-of-external-applications-tcltk-configure">Cross-compilation of external applications: Tcl/Tk (configure)</h2>
<p>R is distibuted with a binary build of Tcl/Tk (aka “Tcl/Tk bundle”), which is
needed for the <code>tcltk</code> package and can be used from R, but also can be used
externally. Since R 4.2, the bundle is cross-compiled on Linux and only
supports 64-bit builds, as does R 4.2. The current version is 8.6.13.
Traditionally the bundle includes TkTable and BWidget. It is already part of
R distribution, so the description here is only to give an example.</p>
<p>Scripts used to build the bundle are available in subversion
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/tcl_bundle">here</a>.</p>
<p>One needs first to download the toolchain tarball, a file named such as
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-base-6094.tar.zst</code> from Rtools44, available
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a>. This
tarball includes the libraries and headers, which are needed, and the native
compiler toolchain, which is not. We also need to download the
cross-compiler tarball, a file named such as
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-cross-6094.tar.zst</code>.</p>
<p>These should be extracted in the same directory, <code>/usr/lib/mxe/usr</code> (or a
directory simlinked from there), e.g.</p>
<pre><code>cd /usr/lib/mxe/usr
tar xf rtools44-toolchain-libs-base-6094.tar.zst
tar xf rtools44-toolchain-libs-cross-6094.tar.zst</code></pre>
<p>When targeting ARM, these tarballs would be named
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-base-aarch64-6094.tar.zst</code> and
<code>rtools44-toolchain-libs-cross-aarch64-6094.tar.zst</code> and would be extracted
to <code>/usr/lib/mxe/usr_aarch64</code>.</p>
<p>The cross-compiler needs to be put on PATH</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/usr/lib/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH</code></pre>
<p>The concrete commands can be found in the script and the bundle had to be
patched to build successfuly with this version of GCC and UCRT, but a
general rule applicable to also other software is that one again needs to
specify the host and target, <code>x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix</code> (this
identification is used by MXE, below referred to as <code>TRIPLET</code>), so e.g. </p>
<pre><code>BINST=`pwd`/Tcl
./configure --enable-64bit --prefix=$BINST --enable-threads --bindir=$BINST/bin --libdir=$BINST/lib --target=$TRIPLET --host=$TRIPLET</code></pre>
<p>is used to configure Tcl.</p>
<p>When building for ARM, use <code>--enable-64bit=arm" in the configure command above.  The</code>TRIPLET<code>is</code>aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix`.</p>
<p>The “base” toolchain bundle is sufficient for Tcl/Tck, but some other
software may require the “full” bundle, which has more pre-compiled
libraries.</p>
<h2 id="cross-compilation-of-external-libraries-nlopt-cmake">Cross-compilation of external libraries: Nlopt (cmake)</h2>
<p>Similarly to the native compilation of Nlopt, one can also cross-compile it
(again, please note this is just an example, as Nlopt is already present in
Rtools44). Set up the cross-compiler as for Tcl/Tk, but in addition create
links for the cross-compilers to be found by cmake.</p>
<pre><code>cd /usr/lib/mxe/usr
ln -st x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin \
  ../../bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix-gcc \
  ../../bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix-g++</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, see the section on “Setting up MXE build from pre-built tarballs”
for how to set up compiler cache for the cross-compilers instead of those
links.</p>
<p>Once this is done, build NLopt as follows:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/usr/lib/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH
tar xf v2.7.1.tar.gz
mkdir build
cd build
x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix-cmake ../nlopt-2.7.1 \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DNLOPT_PYTHON=OFF \
      -DNLOPT_OCTAVE=OFF -DNLOPT_MATLAB=OFF -DNLOPT_GUILE=OFF \
      -DNLOPT_SWIG=OFF
x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix-cmake --build .</code></pre>
<p>When targeting ARM, the links for the compiler are already present. The
toolchain is extracted under <code>/usr/lib/mxe/usr_aarch64</code>. The compilation can
be done by</p>
<pre><code>aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix-cmake ../nlopt-2.7.1 \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DNLOPT_PYTHON=OFF \
      -DNLOPT_OCTAVE=OFF -DNLOPT_MATLAB=OFF -DNLOPT_GUILE=OFF \

aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix-cmake --build .</code></pre>
<h2 id="versioning-of-the-rtools44-components">Versioning of the Rtools44 components</h2>
<p>The Rtools44 files are available <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Names of those for the Intel target are like:</p>
<pre><code>rtools44-6094-6039.exe

tcltk-6094-5412.zip</code></pre>
<p>In the above, 6094 is the version of the toolchain. 6039 is the version of
scripts used to build the Rtools44 installer. 5412 is the version of scripts
used to build the Tcl/Tk bundle.</p>
<p>The version of the toolchain is also stored in file
<code>x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/.version</code> in all the toolchain
distributions and Rtools44 installed via the installer.</p>
<p>These versions correspond to subversion releases of these subversion
directories for the toolchain, the rtools installer, and the Tcl/Tk bundle:</p>
<pre><code>https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/toolchain_libs
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/WindowsBuilds/winutf8/ucrt3/rtools

<p>Names of the files for the ARM target are like:</p>

<p>The version of the toolchain is also stored in file
<code>aarch64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/.version</code> in all the toolchain
distributions and Rtools44 installed via the installer.</p>
<p>Please note that to be able to fully reproduce the builds, one also needs
exactly the same versions of external software (both executables but also
source code for all open-source software that is built into the toolchain
libraries). The repositories shown have docker scripts to ensure that the
exact versions used are recorded and the process is reproducible from
scratch. Also, MXE uses backup download locations for software libraries.
However, in case of interest in fully reproducing the builds, it is adviced
to do that rather soon, when the external software will most likely still be
downloadable, and keep copies for later use.</p>
