<P>
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics.  It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and
environment, which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly
AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.  R
can be considered as another implementation of the S language in a
different environment.  There are some important differences, but much
code written for S runs unaltered under R.

<P>
R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is
highly extensible.  The S language is often the vehicle of choice for
research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source
route to participate in that activity.

<P>
One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed
publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical
symbols and formulae where needed.  Great care has been taken over the 
defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user
retains full control.

<H4><A NAME="environment" HREF="#TOCenvironment">The R environment</A></H4>

<P>
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data
manipulation, calculation and graphical display.  It includes

<UL>
<LI>an effective data handling and storage facility,

<LI>a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,

<LI>a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data
analysis,

<LI>graphical facilities for data analysis and display either
on-screen or on hardcopy, and

<LI>a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which
includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and
input and output facilities.

</UL>

<P>
The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully
planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of
very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other
data analysis software.

<P>
S is designed as a true computer language, and it allows users to add
additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system
is itself written in the S language, which makes it easy for users to
follow the algorithmic choices made.  For computationally-intensive
tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.
Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.

<P>
Many users think of R as a statistics system.  We prefer to think of
it of an environment within which statistical techniques are
implemented.  R can be extended (easily) via <EM>packages</EM>. There
are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many
more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering
a very wide range of modern statistics.

<P>
R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply
comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and
in hardcopy.

<P>
<H4><A HREF="#TOCdownloading" NAME="downloading">Downloading R</A></H4>

<P>
R can be found on <tt><A
HREF="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</A></tt>,
the master site of comprehensive R archive network, or at one of its
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">mirrors</a>.

<P>
It is available as source code and as binary distributions for a
number of GNU/Linux and Unix platforms, and for Microsoft Windows.
