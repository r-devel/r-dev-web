<h1>Embedding R in Other Applications</h1>

On Unix, it is possible to compile R as a stand-alone library that can
be linked with or dynamically loaded into other applications. One can
then use the programming interface defined in the <a
href="http://www.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf">Writing R
Extensions</a> to evaluate R expressions, call R functions, access the
math routines, provide a well-defined and complete scripting language,
etc.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
There is little doubt that embedding the R library within
a C routine that acts as a regular shell command is overkill.
To do this, one could execute R in batch mode with a specified
script that queried the vector <a
href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-alpha/library/base/html/commandArgs.html"><code
class="Rfunction">commandArgs()</code></a>.
If C code is needed, it can be dynamically loaded into R (possibly with
equal or less effort than creating an embedded application).
In this case, the functionality of the application is achieved
without the application being in control. Instead, R is the
"<i>server</i>" in the setup.
<p>

Even graphical interfaces which would appear to need to be in control
of an application need not use the embedded R library.  Instead, the
regular stand-alone R can be used, again in batch mode, to invoke the R
commands to create the GUI (using either of the <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSJava/index.html">Java</a> or <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-alpha/library/tcltk/html/00Index.html">TclTk</a>
packages, or coding it directly in C using one of the GUI libraries
and contending with the event loop!).

<p>

However, the embedded R mechanism is useful in applications that
really must be in control of initialization and execution.  Long
running servers are natural examples. The Postgres and MySQL servers
are examples of such applications.  Dynamic, event-driven processing
systems that are given data at different times and update their
computations accordingly (e.g. produce new reports and plots,
inventory tracking, user signatures, etc.) are other examples.  The
Apache server is another example of where embedding a statistical
environment is useful in two regards.  Firstly, the R language can be
used to generate pages in the same way that Perl, PHP, etc. are
employed. A simple CGI command that specifies an R expression that
uses the RSDBI package to extract values from a database and generate
a plot (in Postscript, PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.) and return a page
containing that image can be a simple way to produce high-quality
graphics without the overhead of starting R each time.

<p>

Not only can servers such as Postgres, MySQL and Apache allow its
users to employ R by embedding it as a module, these systems might
also use the statistical facilities (either native routines or via the
interpreted language) to govern their own behavior. Computing models
for transactions so that Apache can pre-fetch pages for clients or
reorganize its own caches to optimize current activity are natural
uses of the modelling code in R. Similarly, Postgres can tailor its
performance by incrementally computing statistics about its own
behavior.



<h2>Test Applications</h2>
The initial example that was used to test this setup was embedding R
within Postgres for use as a procedural language.
This allows (privileged) users to define SQL functions as
R functions, expressions, etc.  Additionally, tests were
done by evaluating R expressions within
<ol>
  <li> a simple application that dynamically loaded
      <code class="sharedLibary">libR.so</code>
  <li> ggobi that is linked against
      <code class="sharedLibary">libR.so</code>
      and contains a GUI callback.
      (This is not a very practical example
       as ggobi can be entirely embedded and controlled
       from within R.)
</ol>


<h2>Linking the R library</h2>
<pre class="Make">
  $(CC) -L$(R_HOME)/bin -lR
</pre>

<h2>Initializing R from within an Application</h2>

Currently, the following code will initialize the R engine.
<pre class="C">
void initR() {
 char *argv[] = {"REmbeddedPostgres", "--gui=none", "--silent"};
 int argc = sizeof(argv)/sizeof(argv[0]);

  Rf_initEmbeddedR(argc, argv);
}
</pre>

When this is called, the environment variables such as <code
class="environmentVar">R_HOME</code>, <code
class="environmentVar">R_PROFILE</code>, <code
class="environmentVar">R_LIBS</code> should be appropriately set.
There are a variety of tools which can help an application read
configuration details. (For example, the C++ properties library in the
Omegahat distribution allows one to read a file containing <code>name:
value</code> pairs.  )



<h2>Handling Errors</h2>

An application that embeds R must be careful to take care of handling
errors that occur within the R engine appropriately.  In the
stand-alone version of R, an error will (after other
<code class="Rfunction">on.error()</code> activities in each evaluation frame) return
control to the main input-eval-print loop.  In general, this is not
what is desired within another application.  Instead, we want to trap
such R errors and handle them from where the application passed
control to the R engine.

<p>

In the absence of exceptions (either in R or its internal code), we
can trap such errors by overriding the <code
class="Croutine">jump_now()</code> routine in <code
class="sharedLibrary">libR.so</code>.
<pre class="C">
  void jump_now(void)
</pre>
An application can define this
method to handle R errors as it wants. When the routines in <code
class="sharedLibrary">libR.so</code> call this routine, they will end
up calling the application's version.

<p>
The important C routine provided by R for use within
<code class="Croutine">jump_now()</code>
is <code class="Croutine">Rf_resetStack()</code>.
<pre class="C">
  void Rf_resetStack(int topLevelReset)
</pre>

This resets the state of the R evaluator to clear the error.  Embedded
applications will usually call this with a non-zero argument value.
This indicates that the routine should reset the <code
class="Csymbol">R_GlobalContext</code>.  If this is not done,
subsequent errors (i.e. the 2nd) will result in an infinite loop in
<code class="Croutine">jump_to_toplevel()</code>

<h3>Example</h3>
For embedding in Postgres, we currently provide the
following (minimal) implementation of <code class="Croutine">jump_now()</code>
<pre class="C">
void jump_now()
{
extern void Rf_resetStack(int topLevel);
fprintf(stderr, "Handling R error locally\n");
  resetStack(1);
  elog(ERROR, "Error in R");
}
</pre>

<p>
Further work is needed here to intercept the error handling
at an earlier stage (e.g. so that messages are not printed
on the console, etc.), and to access the contents of the error
buffer containing error/warning messages, etc.


<h2>Handling The Event Loop</h2>

As we have encountered when integrating other software into R and
handling blocking I/O, software that assumes that it is in control of
waiting for events can be challenging to embed in another application.
So as to not inflict this same problem on others, R should be able to
export the file descriptors on which it is waiting for events and also
the individual callbacks associated with each these file descriptors.
It is inconceivable that we can have a common C-level signature for
the callbacks across different applications (other than those defined
by the "standards" -- X, Gtk, Tk, etc.).  Many applications that have
an event loop do not admit the possibility of different sources of
events, but instead assume there are only e.g.  user events on a GUI
and not on <code>stdin</code> or other connections.



<h2>Compiling the Library</h2>
The library is not compiled automatically during the installation of
<b>R</b>. It can currently be compiled by invoking the command
<pre>
    make ../../bin/libR.so   
</pre>
from within <code class="dir">src/main</code> under the <b>R</b> distribution.
As indicated, the resulting (shared) library is installed into the
directory <code class="dir">bin/</code> within the <b>R</b> distribution.

<p>
 <font color="red">
Note that usually this command will be done after performing
the regular build/installation. Note that that object (i.e.
the <code class="extension">.o</code>) files will typically
have been compiled for linking into a shared library. Specifically,
the will not necessarily contain position independent code (PIC).
Additionally, any files containing code that is conditionally defined in the context
of the embedable shared library (e.g. code inside
 <code class="CPP">#ifdef R_EMBEDDED</code>)
will need to be recompiled with the relevant flags.
 </font>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>
It would be ideal to decompose the functionality provided by
the large <code class="sharedLibrary>libR.so</code> into
a collection of sub-libraries. Then users would be able to
load just those that were needed for their applications.
For example, continuing Brian's work to make the X11 be
dynamically loadable and provide the Math routines
as a stand-alone library, we might consider providing
libraries for the following <i>topics</i>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Parser and abstract syntax tree.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Evaluator.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Graphics.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Modelling.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h3>Multiple Evaluators</h3>

The ability to embed R raises the issue of having multiple evaluators,
multiple threads, multiple users and synchronization of all of these.


<h2>Examples</h2>
This trivial example illustrates how to initialize the
R environment and invoke an expression
via the <code class="Croutine">eval_R_command()</code>
<pre>
void
init_R()
{
extern Rf_initEmbeddedR(int argc, char **argv);
  int argc = 1;
  char *argv[] = {"ggobi"};

  Rf_initEmbeddedR(argc, argv);
}

 /*
  Calls the equivalent of 
    x <- integer(10)
    for(i in 1:length(x))
       x[i] <- 1
    print(x)
 */
int
eval_R_command()
{
 SEXP e;
 SEXP fun;
 SEXP arg;
 int i;
 void init_R(void);

  init_R();

    fun = Rf_findFun(Rf_install("print"),  R_GlobalEnv);
    PROTECT(fun);
    arg = NEW_INTEGER(10);
    for(i = 0; i < GET_LENGTH(arg); i++)
      INTEGER_DATA(arg)[i]  = i + 1;
    PROTECT(arg);

    e = allocVector(LANGSXP, 2);
    PROTECT(e);
    SETCAR(e, fun);
    SETCAR(CDR(e), arg);

      /* Evaluate the call to the R function.
         Ignore the return value.
       */
    eval(e, R_GlobalEnv);
    UNPROTECT(3);   
  return(0);
}
</pre>


<h2>Routines for the Embedded R</h2>

The following are the routines that are now visible from the shared
library that directly relate to the embedded version of R and are not
in the regular API (i.e. mentioned in <a
href="http://www.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf">Writing R
Extensions</a>).

 <table>
  <tr align=center><td><font class="TD">Routine</code></td><td><font class="TD">Description</font></td></tr>
  <tr align=left><th>void
	  <code class="Croutine">jump_now</code>(void)</th><th>Should be overridden by the
	      application loading <code  class="sharedLibrary">libR.so</code>
	      so as to handle errors in R commands. It usually calls
	      <code class="Croutine">Rf_resetStack()</code>
	      and returns control to the application.
	  </th></tr>
  <tr align=left><th>int
	  <code class="Croutine">Rf_resetStack</code>(int resetTopLevel)</th><th>
           Resets the R evaluator after an error so that subsequent
	    evaluations can proceed appropriately. This should be called with
	      a non-zero argument from applications that embed R.
	  </th></tr>
  <tr align=left><th>int <code class="Croutine">Rf_initEmbeddedR</code>(int argc,
	  char **argv)</th><th>Initializes the R environment,
	  passing the specified strings as if they were from the
	      command line.  The appropriate environment variables
	   should be set before calling this routine.</th></tr>
