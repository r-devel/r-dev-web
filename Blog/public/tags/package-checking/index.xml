      <title>Enhancements to HTML Documentation</title>

      <description>The upcoming release of R (version 4.2.0) features several enhancements to the HTML help system.
The most noticeable features are that LaTeX-like mathematical equations in help pages are now typeset using either KaTeX or MathJax, and usage and example code are highlighted using Prism. Additionally, the output of examples and demos can now be shown within the browser if the knitr package is installed. This is especially useful if the examples produce graphical output.</description>

      <title>Common PROTECT Errors</title>
      <link>https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/04/18/common-protect-errors/</link>

      <description>This post presents the most common PROTECT bugs present in packages, based on manual inspection of ~100 remaining CRAN packages with reports from rchk.
Background Any C/C++ code interacting with R, both inside R itself and in packages, needs to inform the garbage collector about which objects on the R heap are reachable from local variables. Pointers to such objects are kept on the pointer protection stack or the precious list or multi-set, but the most common is the pointer protection stack with PROTECT/UNPROTECT macros.</description>

      <title>Conditions of Length Greater Than One</title>

      <description>Historically R language allows conditions in if and while statements to be vectors (of length greater than one). The first element is used but the remaining elements are ignored, since November 2002 also with a warning (added by Brian Ripley). Following an intuition that such situations would typically arise from a programming error, an option has been added in March 2017 to optionally allow signalling a runtime error, instead (the patch was by Martin Maechler, pinged by a suggestion of Henrik Bengtsson on the R-devel mailing list).</description>
