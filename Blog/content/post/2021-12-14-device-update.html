<p>A number of new graphics features have been added to the R graphics
engine in the development version of R (to become version 4.2.0):<br />
groups, compositing operators, affine
transformations, stroking and filling paths, and luminance masks.
This has consequences for R packages that provide graphics devices,
like the ‘ragg’ package.</p>
<p>For users of R
packages that provide graphics devices,
those packages will need to be reinstalled when
updating to R 4.2.0.</p>
<p>For the <em>maintainers</em> of R
packages that provide graphics devices, this document describes
the changes that are necessary to update a graphics device package
in preparation for R 4.2.0.</p>
<p>All an R user should need to know is to reinstall graphics device
packages; the rest of this document is more technical and aimed
at R developers who maintain graphics device packages.</p>
<div id="option-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Option 1</h1>
<p>The first option is easy: do nothing.</p>
<p>With the addition of the <code>deviceVersion</code> for graphics devices,
the graphics engine is able to detect that a graphics device
has not been updated and it will not ask a device to do things
that it does not support.</p>
<p>The only problem that should occur is if the graphics device package
is not reinstalled, and the package uses <code>R_GE_checkVersionOrDie()</code>,
then the package will fail with a “version mismatch” error.
The solution in that case will be to reinstall the graphics device.</p>
</div>
<div id="option-2" class="section level1">
<h1>Option 2</h1>
<p>The second option is also relatively easy: do almost nothing.</p>
<p>This option involves updating the graphics device package
to set the <code>deviceVersion</code> to 15 (<code>R_GE_group</code>), but
without providing support for any of the new features.</p>
<p>The new graphics engine version requires that the graphics device
provides the following new device callbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>defineGroup()</code></li>
<li><code>useGroup()</code></li>
<li><code>releaseGroup()</code></li>
<li><code>stroke()</code></li>
<li><code>fill()</code></li>
<li><code>fillStroke()</code></li>
<li><code>capabilities()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, it is possible to provide a stub that does nothing.
The graphics engine will call the device, but
there will just be no output produced.</p>
<p>The <code>postscript()</code> graphics device provides a template for this
approach. A graphics device package can model its device
callbacks on functions like <code>PS_defineGroup()</code> in <code>devPS.c</code>.</p>
<p>A more ambitious variant of this option is to provide support for just a subset
of the new features; that is also a less ambitious variant of the
next option …</p>
</div>
<div id="option-3" class="section level1">
<h1>Option 3</h1>
<p>This option is a lot harder: add support for the new features.</p>
<p>For some graphics devices, this will not be an option because the
language or library underlying the graphics device does not
support the new features. The <code>xfig()</code> device is an example.</p>
<p>Where it is possible to add support, the purpose of each of the new
device callbacks is (briefly):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>defineGroup(source, op, destination)</code> should run the R function
<code>destination</code>, set the compositing operator <code>op</code>, then run the R
function <code>source</code>, recording all drawing that occurs as a result
off-screen, and return a reference to the recorded drawing.</li>
<li><code>useGroup(ref, trans)</code> should apply the transformation matrix <code>trans</code>
and render the recorded drawing referenced by <code>ref</code>.</li>
<li><code>releaseGroup(ref)</code> can release resources associated with the
recorded drawing referenced by <code>ref</code>.</li>
<li><code>stroke(path)</code> should run the R function <code>path</code>, recording all
drawing as a path, then stroke the path.</li>
<li><code>fill(path, rule)</code> should run the R function <code>path</code>, recording all
drawing as a path, then fill the path using the fill <code>rule</code>.</li>
<li><code>fillStroke(path, rule)</code> should run the R function <code>path</code>, recording all
drawing as a path, then fill and stroke the path using the fill <code>rule</code>.</li>
<li><code>capabilities(capabilities)</code> should modify components of the list
<code>capabilities</code> to indicate the level of support provided by the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>pdf()</code> device and the devices based on the Cairo graphics library,
e.g., <code>png(type="cairo")</code> and <code>svg()</code>,
provide exemplars of devices that have implemented support for the
new features. See, for example, <code>PDF_defineGroup()</code> in <code>devPS.c</code>
and <code>Cairo_DefineGroup()</code> in <code>cairoFns.c</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-ints.html#Graphics-devices">“Graphics Devices” Section</a>
of the “R Internals” Manual also
contains some more detailed information, particularly about the
<code>capabilities()</code> device callback.</p>
